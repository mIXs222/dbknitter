Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nPerform an in-depth analysis of profit distribution across different nations over the years, focusing specifically on parts containing the term 'dim.' The analysis spans multiple tables, including 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'partsupp,' 'orders,' and 'nation.'\n\nFor each relevant line item, the amount of profit is calculated, considering the extended price after discount adjustments and subtracting the supply cost multiplied by the quantity. This detailed computation is conducted for parts with names containing the term 'dim.' The results are then associated with the respective nation and year of the order.\n\nThe data is grouped by nation and year, facilitating a detailed breakdown of profit distribution over time across different nations. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the nation and in descending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of profit dynamics associated with parts containing 'dim' across various nations.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
