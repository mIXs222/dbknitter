Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nRetrieve a detailed breakdown of the total revenue generated by orders placed by customers in the 'ASIA' region. This analysis spans the time period from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1994. The calculation of revenue considers the extended price of line items, accounting for applicable discounts.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'customer,' 'orders,' 'lineitem,' 'supplier,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between customers, orders, line items, suppliers, and their respective nations and regions. Only data related to the 'ASIA' region is considered, determined by matching nation and region keys. The time frame is further constrained by including only orders placed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1994.\n\nThe results are then grouped by nation name, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation across different nations within the 'ASIA' region. The grouping is based on the total revenue for each nation, calculated by summing the extended price of line items after discount adjustments.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue, providing a detailed breakdown showcasing the nations in the 'ASIA' region, their respective total revenues, and how they contribute to the overall revenue picture during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
