Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nPerform a comprehensive analysis of revenue generated from line items and associated parts, considering multiple sets of conditions for the selection. The analysis focuses on specific brands, containers, quantities, sizes, shipping modes, and shipping instructions for both 'Brand#12,' 'Brand#23,' and 'Brand#34.'\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and parts. The selection criteria include various sets of conditions, each specified within an 'OR' clause:\n\nFor parts with 'Brand#12' and containers ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG'), quantities between 1 and 11, sizes between 1 and 5, shipping modes ('AIR', 'AIR REG'), and shipping instruction 'DELIVER IN PERSON.'\nFor parts with 'Brand#23' and containers ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK'), quantities between 10 and 20, sizes between 1 and 10, shipping modes ('AIR', 'AIR REG'), and shipping instruction 'DELIVER IN PERSON.'\nFor parts with 'Brand#34' and containers ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG'), quantities between 20 and 30, sizes between 1 and 15, shipping modes ('AIR', 'AIR REG'), and shipping instruction 'DELIVER IN PERSON.'\nThe revenue is calculated as the sum of extended prices adjusted for discounts for all line items meeting the specified conditions.\n\nThe results provide insights into the total revenue generated from line items associated with parts meeting the specified brand, container, quantity, size, shipping mode, and shipping instruction criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (get_revenue.py) that will execute the given query on your MySQL database and write the output to the file `query_output.csv`:

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

Now, here is the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies needed to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install python3 and python3-pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to set the executable permission for the Bash script before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
