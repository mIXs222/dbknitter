Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nRetrieve detailed insights into order priorities during a specific timeframe from July 1, 1993, to October 1, 1993. The analysis considers not just the number of orders but incorporates a nuanced criterion. Only orders with associated line items where the commitment date precedes the receipt date are included in the count.\n\nFor each order priority, calculate the count of such orders meeting the aforementioned conditions. This detailed examination aims to provide a granular understanding of how order priorities are distributed, taking into account the temporal constraints and the commitment-receipt date relationship of associated line items.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the order priority, offering a clear and insightful portrayal of order priorities and their counts within the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the query on your original MySQL database:

```python
# mysql_query.py
import pymysql
import csv

# Connection details
mysql_config = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# Connect to MySQL
connection = pymysql.connect(**mysql_config)
try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # SQL query
        query = """
        SELECT O_ORDERPRIORITY, COUNT(DISTINCT O_ORDERKEY) as order_count
        FROM orders
        INNER JOIN lineitem ON O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
        WHERE O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1993-07-01' AND '1993-10-01'
        AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE
        GROUP BY O_ORDERPRIORITY
        ORDER BY O_ORDERPRIORITY ASC;
        """
        cursor.execute(query)

        # Fetch the results
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write results to CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            csv_writer.writerow(['O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'order_count'])
            for row in results:
                csv_writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    connection.close()
```

And here is the corresponding bash script to install all the dependencies needed to run the python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package manager
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip (if not already installed)
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure you have execution permissions for the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before attempting to execute it. After you run the .sh script, you can execute the .py script using Python 3.
