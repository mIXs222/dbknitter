Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct a thorough analysis of market share for a specific type of part, 'SMALL PLATED COPPER,' within the 'ASIA' region. The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the year of the order and the calculated market share, specifically focusing on the nation 'INDIA.'\n\nTo achieve this, data is derived from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between parts, suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations and regions. The focus is on the 'ASIA' region and the specific part type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER.'\n\nFor each order, the volume is calculated as the extended price of line items adjusted for discounts. The volume is associated with the respective nation, considering the 'INDIA' nation. The results are then grouped by the year of the order.\n\nThe market share is computed by summing the volumes associated with 'INDIA' and dividing it by the total volume. This provides a detailed understanding of the market share dynamics for the specified part type within the 'ASIA' region, specifically highlighting the contribution of 'INDIA' over the years 1995 and 1996.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of market share trends for the 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' part in the 'ASIA' region during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the described query and write the results to `query_output.csv`. Save this code as `query_analysis.py`:

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Define the MySQL connection parameters
mysql_config = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'database': 'tpch'
}

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_config)
try:
    mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

    # Define the query to be executed
    mysql_query = """
    SELECT O_ORDERDATE, SUM(IF(N_NAME = 'INDIA', L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT), 0)) AS volume_india,
           SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_volume
    FROM lineitem
    JOIN orders ON L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
    JOIN customer ON O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY
    JOIN nation ON C_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
    JOIN region ON N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY
    JOIN supplier ON L_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY
    JOIN part ON L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
    WHERE P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'
      AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'
      AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'
    GROUP BY YEAR(O_ORDERDATE)
    ORDER BY YEAR(O_ORDERDATE) ASC;
    """

    # Execute the query
    mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)

    # Fetch the results
    results = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

    # Write the query output to a CSV file
    with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        # Write the headers
        writer.writerow(["Year", "Market Share in India"])
        # Write the data
        for row in results:
            year = row[0].year
            market_share = row[1] / row[2] if row[2] else 0  # Avoid division by zero
            writer.writerow([year, market_share])

finally:
    mysql_conn.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all the dependencies needed to run the above Python code. Save this as `setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure you run the Bash script `setup.sh` to install dependencies before you execute the Python script `query_analysis.py`.
