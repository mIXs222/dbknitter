message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmysql has database named tpch with tables: nation, region, part, supplier, customer, orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mysql:\n- nation: N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME, N_REGIONKEY, N_COMMENT\n- region: R_REGIONKEY, R_NAME, R_COMMENT\n- part: P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT\n- supplier: S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL, S_COMMENT\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mysql, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- username: root\n- password: my-secret-pw\n- hostname: mysql\n- instruction: Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct a thorough analysis of market share for a specific type of part, 'SMALL PLATED COPPER,' within the 'ASIA' region. The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the year of the order and the calculated market share, specifically focusing on the nation 'INDIA.'\n\nTo achieve this, data is derived from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between parts, suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations and regions. The focus is on the 'ASIA' region and the specific part type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER.'\n\nFor each order, the volume is calculated as the extended price of line items adjusted for discounts. The volume is associated with the respective nation, considering the 'INDIA' nation. The results are then grouped by the year of the order.\n\nThe market share is computed by summing the volumes associated with 'INDIA' and dividing it by the total volume. This provides a detailed understanding of the market share dynamics for the specified part type within the 'ASIA' region, specifically highlighting the contribution of 'INDIA' over the years 1995 and 1996.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of market share trends for the 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' part in the 'ASIA' region during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
