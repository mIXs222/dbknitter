Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nPerform a detailed analysis of the average yearly extended price for a specific brand and container type of parts. The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the part brand is 'Brand#23' and the container type is 'MED BAG.' Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
