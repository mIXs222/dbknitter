Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct a detailed analysis of promotional revenue as a percentage of total revenue for a specific timeframe. The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the shipping date falls between September 1, 1995, and September 30, 1995. The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to generate the required data:

```python
import pymysql
import csv
from decimal import Decimal

# Database connection
conn_info = {
    "host": "mysql",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "db": "tpch",
    "charset": "utf8mb4"
}

# Function to execute query in MySQL and return results
def query_mysql(query, connection_info):
    try:
        connection = pymysql.connect(**connection_info)
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(query)
            results = cursor.fetchall()
        return results
    finally:
        connection.close()

# Define the SQL query
query = """
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%%' THEN l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT) ELSE 0 END) AS promo_revenue,
    SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    lineitem l 
INNER JOIN 
    part p ON l.L_PARTKEY = p.P_PARTKEY
WHERE 
    l.L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-09-01' AND '1995-09-30';
"""

# Execute the query
results = query_mysql(query, conn_info)

# Calculate the percentage of promotional revenue
promo_revenue = results[0][0] if results and results[0] and results[0][0] else Decimal(0)
total_revenue = results[0][1] if results and results[0] and results[0][1] else Decimal(0)
promo_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue * 100) if total_revenue else Decimal(0)

# Write output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Promo Revenue', 'Total Revenue', 'Promo Revenue Percentage'])
    writer.writerow([str(promo_revenue), str(total_revenue), str(promo_percentage)])
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies required to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already present
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the 'pymysql' library using pip
pip3 install pymysql
