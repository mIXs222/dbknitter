response, Below is the required Python code and Bash script.

First, here is the Python code file (`query_analysis.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Establish a connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# Establish a connection to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Prepare SQL query for MySQL data
mysql_query = """
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_QUANTITY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,

    L_SHIPINSTRUCT
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
    L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
"""

with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['PARTKEY', 'ORDERKEY', 'REVENUE'])

    # Use a cursor to perform the query
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(mysql_query)
        lineitems = cursor.fetchall()

        # Query MongoDB for 'part' data
        for item in lineitems:
            part = mongodb_db.part.find_one({
                'P_PARTKEY': item[1],
                'P_BRAND': {'$in': ['Brand#12', 'Brand#23', 'Brand#34']},

            })
            if part:
                brand = part['P_BRAND']
                container = part['P_CONTAINER']
                size = part['P_SIZE']
                quantity = item[2]

                # Check conditions based on the brand
                if (brand == 'Brand#12' and 1 <= quantity <= 11 and 1 <= size <= 5) or \
                   (brand == 'Brand#23' and 10 <= quantity <= 20 and 1 <= size <= 10) or \
                   (brand == 'Brand#34' and 20 <= quantity <= 30 and 1 <= size <= 15):
                    # Calculate revenue
                    revenue = item[3] * (1 - item[4])  # extended price * (1 - discount)
                    writer.writerow([item[1], item[0], revenue])

mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

Next is the Bash script file (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all required dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip, if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the Python MongoDB driver (pymongo)
pip3 install pymongo

# Install the pymysql package for MySQL
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to give the bash script execution permissions using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
