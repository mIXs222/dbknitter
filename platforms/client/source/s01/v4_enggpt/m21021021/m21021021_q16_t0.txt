The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# Python code: analyze_parts_suppliers.py

import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import pymongo
import direct_redis

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Execute MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT
FROM part
WHERE P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45' 
AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%%'
AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9);
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)

# Fetch data from MySQL
part_data = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cursor.fetchall(), columns=['P_PARTKEY', 'P_NAME', 'P_MFGR', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'P_CONTAINER', 'P_RETAILPRICE', 'P_COMMENT'])

mysql_conn.close()

# MongoDB connection and query
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
parts_collection = mongo_db['partsupp']

# Fetch data from MongoDB
partsupp_data = pd.DataFrame(list(parts_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Redis connection
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get supplier data from Redis
supplier_data = pd.DataFrame(eval(redis_client.get('supplier')))

# Merge data frames
merged_data = pd.merge(part_data, partsupp_data, how='inner', left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')

# Remove suppliers with unwanted comments
merged_data = merged_data[~merged_data['PS_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Calculate count of distinct suppliers for each combination of brand, type, and size
supplier_count = merged_data.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])['PS_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index(name='SUPPLIER_CNT')

# Sort results
supplier_count.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True], inplace=True)

# Write to CSV
supplier_count.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script to install all necessary dependencies, assuming you are using a system with apt and pip available:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script: install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and install Python pip
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip

# Install required python libraries
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo direct-redis
