Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (python_code.py):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Fetch parts with brand 'Brand#23' and container type 'MED BAG' from MySQL
mysql_cursor.execute(
    "SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part WHERE P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'"
)
part_keys = [row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]

# MongoDB connection
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongodb_db['lineitem']

# Fetch average quantities for the selected parts from MongoDB
avg_quantities = {}
for key in part_keys:
    avg_qty = lineitem_collection.aggregate([
        {"$match": {"L_PARTKEY": key}},
        {"$group": {"_id": "$L_PARTKEY", "avgQuantity": {"$avg": "$L_QUANTITY"}}}
    ])
    result = list(avg_qty)
    if result:
        avg_quantities[key] = result[0]['avgQuantity'] * 0.2

# Fetch line items that fulfill the average quantity condition from MongoDB
matching_lineitems = []
for part_key, qty_threshold in avg_quantities.items():
    lineitems = lineitem_collection.find({
        "L_PARTKEY": part_key,
        "L_QUANTITY": {"$lt": qty_threshold}
    }, {"L_EXTENDEDPRICE": 1, "L_QUANTITY": 1})
    for item in lineitems:
        item['yearly_avg'] = item['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] / 7.0
        matching_lineitems.append(item)

# Writing to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Part Key', 'Extended Price', 'Yearly Avg'])
    for item in matching_lineitems:
        writer.writerow([item['L_PARTKEY'], item['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'], item['yearly_avg']])

# Cleanup and close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install pip (if it's not already installed)
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the Python MySQL driver
pip3 install pymysql

# Install the Python MongoDB driver
pip3 install pymongo
