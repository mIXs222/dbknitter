This analysis spans the time period from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1994. The calculation of revenue considers the extended price of line items, accounting for applicable discounts.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'customer,' 'orders,' 'lineitem,' 'supplier,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between customers, orders, line items, suppliers, and their respective nations and regions. Only data related to the 'ASIA' region is considered, determined by matching nation and region keys. The time frame is further constrained by including only orders placed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1994.\n\nThe results are then grouped by nation name, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation across different nations within the 'ASIA' region. The grouping is based on the total revenue for each nation, calculated by summing the extended price of line items after discount adjustments.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue, providing a detailed breakdown showcasing the nations in the 'ASIA' region, their respective total revenues, and how they contribute to the overall revenue picture during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to achieve the described scenario:

```python
# revenue_analysis.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Redis Connection
redis_conn = DirectRedis(port=6379, host='redis')

# Retrieve data from redis
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('nation'))
supplier_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('supplier'))
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('orders'))

# Filter orders based on date
start_date = datetime(1990, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(1994, 12, 31)
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
orders_df = orders_df[(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] >= start_date) & (orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] <= end_date)]

# Retrieve data from mysql
mysql_cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM customer')
customer_records = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(customer_records, columns=["C_CUSTKEY", "C_NAME", "C_ADDRESS", "C_NATIONKEY", "C_PHONE", "C_ACCTBAL", "C_MKTSEGMENT", "C_COMMENT"])

# Retrieve data from mongodb
region_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.region.find({}, {'_id': 0})))
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.lineitem.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis_conn.close()

# Join operations
region_asia_df = region_df[region_df['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA']
asia_nations_df = nation_df[nation_df['N_REGIONKEY'].isin(region_asia_df['R_REGIONKEY'])]
asia_customers_df = customer_df[customer_df['C_NATIONKEY'].isin(asia_nations_df['N_NATIONKEY'])]
asia_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'].isin(asia_customers_df['C_CUSTKEY'])]
asia_lineitems_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_ORDERKEY'].isin(asia_orders_df['O_ORDERKEY'])]
asia_suppliers_df = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(asia_nations_df['N_NATIONKEY'])]

# Calculate the revenue
asia_lineitems_df['REVENUE'] = asia_lineitems_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - asia_lineitems_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
nation_revenue = asia_lineitems_df.groupby(asia_nations_df['N_NAME'].values)['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()
nation_revenue.columns = ['N_NAME', 'TOTAL_REVENUE']
nation_revenue.sort_values('TOTAL_REVENUE', ascending=False, inplace=True)

# Write the final result to csv
nation_revenue.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```
And now for the Bash script to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update your package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Redis and MongoDB clients, as well as directly accessible Redis in Python
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo direct-redis
```
