The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code that connects to both MySQL and MongoDB, computes the promotional revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the specified timeframe, and writes the results to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Date format
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d"

# Query MySQL for part types that start with 'PROMO'
mycursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
mycursor.execute("SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part WHERE P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%'")
promo_parts = set(row[0] for row in mycursor.fetchall())

# Query MongoDB for lineitem data
lineitem_collection = mongodb_db['lineitem']

start_date = datetime.strptime('1995-09-01', date_format)
end_date = datetime.strptime('1995-09-30', date_format)

lineitems = lineitem_collection.find({
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lte': end_date}
})

# Calculation
promo_revenue = 0
total_revenue = 0

for lineitem in lineitems:
    extended_price = lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE']
    discount = lineitem['L_DISCOUNT']
    partkey = lineitem['L_PARTKEY']
    revenue = extended_price * (1 - discount)
    total_revenue += revenue
    if partkey in promo_parts:
        promo_revenue += revenue

# Calculate the percentage
promo_revenue_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Write to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Promo Revenue Percentage'])
    writer.writerow([promo_revenue_percentage])

# Close connections
mycursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

And here is the bash script that installs the dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python3 and PIP
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
