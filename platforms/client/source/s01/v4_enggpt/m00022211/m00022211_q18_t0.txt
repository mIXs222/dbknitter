The analysis aims to identify customers, orders, and line items where the total quantity of items in an order exceeds 300 units.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve the following:\n\nSelection of orders where the order key is in the set of order keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery identifies order keys with a total quantity of items exceeding 300.\nMatching customer key in orders and line items.\nMatching order key in orders and line items.\nThe subquery calculates the total quantity of items per order key and selects only those order keys where the total quantity exceeds 300.\n\nThe main query then retrieves information such as customer name ('C_NAME'), customer key ('C_CUSTKEY'), order key ('O_ORDERKEY'), order date ('O_ORDERDATE'), total price of the order ('O_TOTALPRICE'), and the sum of quantities of items in the line items associated with each order.\n\nThe results are grouped by customer name, customer key, order key, order date, and total price. The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the total price of the order and then by order date. This ordering provides a detailed view of customer orders meeting the specified quantity criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code you requested:

```python
# query.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Function to connect to MongoDB
def connect_mongodb(host, port, db_name):
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(host, port)
    db = client[db_name]
    return db

# Function to connect to Redis, assuming direct_redis is a custom module for this context
def connect_redis(host, port, db_name):
    return direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=host, port=port, db=int(db_name))

# Connecting to MongoDB
db_mongo = connect_mongodb("mongodb", 27017, "tpch")

# Fetching data from MongoDB collections
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db_mongo.orders.find()))
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db_mongo.lineitem.find()))

# Connecting to Redis
redis_client = connect_redis("redis", 6379, "0")

# Fetching data from Redis. Assuming get returns a dataframe.
customer_df = redis_client.get('customer')

# Converting the Redis customer dataframe id columns to match the naming convention used in the SQL queries
customer_df.rename(columns={'C_CUSTKEY': 'O_CUSTKEY'}, inplace=True)

# Joining the customer DataFrame with the orders DataFrame on customer key
customer_orders = pd.merge(customer_df, orders_df, on="O_CUSTKEY")

# Grouping by L_ORDERKEY and summing L_QUANTITY to find total quantity per order
lineitem_grouped = lineitem_df.groupby('L_ORDERKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].sum().reset_index()
# Filter the order keys with total quantity > 300
lineitem_filtered = lineitem_grouped[lineitem_grouped['L_QUANTITY'] > 300]

# Join the orders with the line items that have total quantity > 300
matching_orders = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERKEY'].isin(lineitem_filtered['L_ORDERKEY'])]

# Join the matching orders with customer_orders
final_result = pd.merge(matching_orders, customer_orders, on="O_ORDERKEY")

# Selecting necessary columns for the final output
final_result = final_result[['C_NAME', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'L_QUANTITY']]

# Group by the necessary columns and sort by total price and order date as per the query requirements
final_result = final_result.groupby(['C_NAME', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE']).agg({'L_QUANTITY':'sum'}).reset_index()
final_result.sort_values(by=['O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True], inplace=True)

# Writing results to query_output.csv
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the corresponding bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip, if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Please note that `direct_redis.DirectRedis` is a placeholder and should be replaced with actual access method available in your working environment, since `direct_redis` package does not exist in the Python standard repositories. If `DirectRedis` is a custom class for your environment, ensure that the package or module is available in the Python environment where the code will be executed.
