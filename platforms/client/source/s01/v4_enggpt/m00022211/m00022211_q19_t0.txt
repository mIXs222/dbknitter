Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the described query:

```python
# Python code to execute the complex query across MySQL and MongoDB databases
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Query setup and execution
with mysql_connection.cursor() as mysql_cursor:
    # Perform the SQL query to fetch relevant parts
    mysql_cursor.execute("""
        SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_BRAND, P_CONTAINER, P_SIZE, P_RETAILPRICE 
        FROM part 
        WHERE (P_BRAND = 'Brand#12' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
           OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
           OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#34' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15)
    """)
    part_results = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Prepare the list of part keys from SQL query results for MongoDB query
part_keys_list = [row[0] for row in part_results]

# Fetch the lineitems from MongoDB matching the part keys
lineitem_collection = mongo_db['lineitem']
lineitem_cursor = lineitem_collection.find({
    'L_PARTKEY': {'$in': part_keys_list},
    'L_QUANTITY': {'$lte': 30},
    'L_SHIPMODE': {'$in': ['AIR', 'AIR REG']},
    'L_SHIPINSTRUCT': 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
})

# Process the query results and write them to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['PartKey', 'Revenue']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    
    # Aggregate and calculate the revenue for each part
    revenue_by_part = {}
    for lineitem in lineitem_cursor:
        if lineitem['L_PARTKEY'] in revenue_by_part:
            revenue_by_part[lineitem['L_PARTKEY']] += lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem['L_DISCOUNT'])
        else:
            revenue_by_part[lineitem['L_PARTKEY']] = lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem['L_DISCOUNT'])
    
    for part in part_results:
        part_key = part[0]
        if part_key in revenue_by_part:
            writer.writerow({'PartKey': part_key, 'Revenue': revenue_by_part[part_key]})
        else:
            writer.writerow({'PartKey': part_key, 'Revenue': 0})

# Close the connections
mysql_connection.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

The bash script for installing all the dependencies to run the Python code above will typically look as follows:

```bash
# Bash script to install dependencies for running Python code
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package manager
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Save these scripts as appropriate `.py` and `.sh` files and run them on your system to execute your complex query. Please note that the CSV output format and fields may need adjusting if additional details are required beyond part keys and revenue.
