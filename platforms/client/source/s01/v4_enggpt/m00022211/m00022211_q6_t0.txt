The analysis focuses on line items with shipping dates between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994. Furthermore, the criteria include line items with a discount falling within a narrow range of 5% (0.06 - 0.01) to 7% (0.06 + 0.01) and a quantity less than 24.\n\nThe computation involves summing the extended price of line items after applying the specified discount criteria. The selected line items are those meeting the conditions of having a shipping date within the designated timeframe, a discount within the specified range, and a quantity less than 24.\n\nThis detailed analysis aims to provide a precise understanding of the revenue generated during the specified period, considering specific discount and quantity constraints on line items.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code (`query_mongodb.py`):

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# MongoDB connection parameters
MONGODB_HOST = 'mongodb'
MONGODB_PORT = 27017
MONGODB_DB_NAME = 'tpch'

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient(host=MONGODB_HOST, port=MONGODB_PORT)
db = client[MONGODB_DB_NAME]

# Define the query
query = {
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': '1994-01-01', '$lte': '1994-12-31'},
    'L_DISCOUNT': {'$gte': 0.05, '$lte': 0.07},
    'L_QUANTITY': {'$lt': 24}
}

# Project the necessary fields
projection = {
    'L_EXTENDEDPRICE': 1,
    'L_DISCOUNT': 1,
    '_id': 0
}

# Execute the query and calculate the total revenue
total_revenue = 0
for document in db.lineitem.find(query, projection):
    total_revenue += document['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - document['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Write the result to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['Total Revenue'])
    writer.writerow([total_revenue])

print("The total revenue has been written to query_output.csv")
```

2. Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install python3 and pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo to be able to connect to MongoDB
pip3 install pymongo
```

Before running this bash script, make sure you have appropriate permissions and the user should have sudo privileges if needed. Moreover, running this in a non-sandboxed or non-containerized environment without understanding its implications might pose security risks or configuration conflicts.
