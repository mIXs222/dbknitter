The analysis distinguishes between customers who have placed orders with specific conditions and those who haven't. The results aim to provide insights into the distribution of customers based on the count of their orders and the presence of certain keywords in the order comments.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer' and 'orders' tables, utilizing a left outer join to ensure all customers are included, regardless of whether they have placed orders or not. The conditions for joining include matching customer and order keys, and the exclusion of orders with comments containing the phrases 'pending' and 'deposits.'\n\nWithin the subquery ('C_ORDERS'), for each customer, the count of orders meeting the specified conditions is calculated.\n\nThe outer query then groups the results by the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). For each count, it calculates the number of customers ('CUSTDIST') with that specific count of orders. The results provide a distribution of customers based on their order counts.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of customers ('CUSTDIST') and, in the case of ties, in descending order based on the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). This ordering offers a comprehensive view of the distribution of customers based on their order counts and the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to perform the described analysis:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Functions to retrieve data from MongoDB and Redis
def get_mongo_data():
    client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
    db = client['tpch']
    orders_collection = db['orders']
    # exclude orders with comments containing 'pending' or 'deposits'
    query = {
        'O_COMMENT': {
            '$not': {
                '$regex': 'pending|deposits',
                '$options': 'i' # case-insensitive
            }
        }
    }
    # Project specific fields to match SQL-like query structure
    projection = {
        '_id': False,
        'O_ORDERKEY': True,
        'O_CUSTKEY': True,
        'O_COMMENT': True
    }
    orders_data = list(orders_collection.find(query, projection))
    return pd.DataFrame(orders_data)

def get_redis_data():
    r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    customer_data_str = r.get('customer')
    customer_data = pd.read_json(customer_data_str)
    return customer_data

# Retrieve data from databases
orders_df = get_mongo_data()
customers_df = get_redis_data()

# Merge data from Mongo and Redis
merged_df = pd.merge(customers_df, orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left')

# Create a subquery to count orders that don't have 'pending' or 'deposits' in comments
subquery = merged_df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY').apply(lambda df: df['O_ORDERKEY'].count()).reset_index(name='C_COUNT')

# Join the subquery back with customers to get counts including zeros
result = pd.merge(customers_df, subquery, on='C_CUSTKEY', how='left')

# Get the distribution of customers by order count 'C_COUNT'
# Count unique customers for each 'C_COUNT'
cust_dist = result['C_COUNT'].value_counts().reset_index()
cust_dist.columns = ['C_COUNT', 'CUSTDIST']

# Sort results according to the instructions
final_result = cust_dist.sort_values(by=['CUSTDIST', 'C_COUNT'], ascending=[False, False])

# Save results to a CSV file
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next is the Bash script to install all dependencies required to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Ensure pymongo, pandas, and direct_redis clients are installed for python3
pip3 install pymongo pandas

# Since 'direct_redis' is not a known package, this is a placeholder
# Replace 'direct_redis_package' with the correct package name if it exists
# pip3 install direct_redis_package

echo "Dependencies for Python script installed."
``` 

Please make sure to adjust the placeholder `direct_redis_package` in the bash script to the actual package name used for the `direct_redis` client, as it doesn't appear to be a standard Python package.
