The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that would execute the described operation:

```python
# File: execute_query.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import json
import direct_redis

# Connection to MySQL (for the 'nation' table)
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    # Query to fetch nation data
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA';")
    nations = cursor.fetchall()
sa_nationkey = [n[0] for n in nations]

# Query to connect and collect data from Redis (assume supplier is in JSON format)
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
supplier_json_data = redis_client.get('supplier')
suppliers_df = pd.DataFrame(json.loads(supplier_json_data))

# Filter suppliers from Saudi Arabia
suppliers_sa = suppliers_df[suppliers_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(sa_nationkey)]

# Connection to MongoDB (for 'orders' and 'lineitem' tables)
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]
lineitem_collection = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# Fetch orders with status 'F'
orders_fulfilled = list(orders_collection.find({"O_ORDERSTATUS": "F"}))

# Convert to DataFrame for easier manipulation
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_fulfilled)

# Fetch all line items
all_lineitems = list(lineitem_collection.find({}))

# Filter lineitems where L_RECEIPTDATE > L_COMMITDATE
lineitems_df = pd.DataFrame(all_lineitems)
lineitems_waiting = lineitems_df[lineitems_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > lineitems_df['L_COMMITDATE']]

# Join and filter the lineitems with the orders
final_lineitems = lineitems_waiting[lineitems_waiting['L_ORDERKEY'].isin(orders_df['O_ORDERKEY'])]

# Calculate NUMWAIT and prepare the final result
waiting_statistics = final_lineitems.groupby('L_SUPPKEY').size().reset_index(name='NUMWAIT')
waiting_statistics = waiting_statistics.rename(columns={'L_SUPPKEY': 'S_SUPPKEY'})

# Join with suppliers to get supplier names
final_result = pd.merge(waiting_statistics, suppliers_sa, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Select and order the relevant columns
final_result = final_result[['S_NAME', 'NUMWAIT']].sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])

# Output the query results to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script to install all necessary dependencies to run the Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# File: install_dependencies.sh

# Updating package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Installing Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Please make sure to give execute permission to the bash script before running it by using the following command:

```sh
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
