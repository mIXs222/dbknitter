The analysis considers the supply cost and available quantity for each part. The results aim to identify parts where the total value (calculated as the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity) exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'partsupp,' 'supplier,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, and nations. The focus is specifically on suppliers in Germany ('N_NAME' is 'GERMANY').\n\nThe results are grouped by part key, and a filtering condition ('HAVING') is applied to select only those groups where the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity surpasses a certain percentage of the overall value for Germany-based suppliers. This threshold is calculated in a subquery.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the calculated value, providing insights into the parts with the highest values that meet the specified conditions for suppliers in Germany.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's a Python script (`query_analysis.py`) that follows the given instructions to connect to multiple databases, perform the analysis, and write the results to `query_output.csv`.

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL connection
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MySQL and retrieve 'nation' table
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    query_nation = "SELECT * FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'GERMANY';"
    cursor.execute(query_nation)
    nations = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['N_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME', 'N_REGIONKEY', 'N_COMMENT'])
    germany_nationkey = nations['N_NATIONKEY'].iloc[0]

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_connection.close()

# Redis connection
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve 'supplier' and 'partsupp' tables from Redis
supplier_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('supplier'))
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('partsupp'))

# Apply filter on suppliers being from Germany using the nation key
german_suppliers = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'] == germany_nationkey]

# Merge partsupp and german suppliers
merged_df = pd.merge(
    partsupp_df,
    german_suppliers,
    how='inner',
    left_on='PS_SUPPKEY',
    right_on='S_SUPPKEY'
)

# Calculate value for each part and supplier
merged_df['VALUE'] = merged_df['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * merged_df['PS_AVAILQTY']

# Group by part key and calculate total value, also, prepare having clause
grouped = merged_df.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').agg({'VALUE': ['sum']})
grouped.columns = ['TOTAL_VALUE']
threshold_percentage = 0.05
overall_value_for_germany = merged_df['VALUE'].sum()
threshold_value = overall_value_for_germany * threshold_percentage

# Filter groups having total value greater than the threshold
filtered_groups = grouped[grouped['TOTAL_VALUE'] > threshold_value]

# Output the final result to csv
filtered_groups = filtered_groups.sort_values(by='TOTAL_VALUE', ascending=False)
filtered_groups.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

Here's a Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies to run that Python script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python pip if not installed
if ! command -v pip &> /dev/null
then
    echo "pip could not be found, installing pip..."
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3-pip
fi

# Install Python dependencies
pip install pymysql pandas redis direct-redis

# Output message
echo "All dependencies are installed"
```

Please note that you should run the Bash script to install dependencies before executing the Python script. Additionally, as we don't have the actual environment and data, ensure that hostnames `mysql` and `redis`, as well as the provided port numbers and database names, correctly correspond to accessible servers in your network.
