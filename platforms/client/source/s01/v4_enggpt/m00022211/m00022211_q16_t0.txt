The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the required Python code to execute the hypothetical query across the described databases:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL and retrieve part table
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
part_query = """
    SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT
    FROM part
    WHERE P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'
      AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
      AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
"""
part_df = pd.read_sql(part_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis and retrieve partsupp and supplier tables
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('partsupp'))
supplier_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('supplier'))

redis_conn.close()

# Filter out suppliers with 'Customer Complaints' in the comments
supplier_df = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Merge the dataframes on matching keys
merged_df = partsupp_df.merge(part_df, left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(supplier_df, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Group and count distinct suppliers
grouped_df = (
    merged_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])
    .agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=pd.NamedAgg(column='S_SUPPKEY', aggfunc='nunique'))
    .reset_index()
)

# Sort the results as specified
sorted_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write the output to query_output.csv
sorted_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next is the Bash script to install all dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
# install.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install Python and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
