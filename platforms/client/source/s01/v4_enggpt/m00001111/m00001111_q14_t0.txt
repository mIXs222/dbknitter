The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the shipping date falls between September 1, 1995, and September 30, 1995. The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that would achieve what the user has asked for:

```python
# Python code to execute the query on original data
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Convert shipping date to datetime
def parse_date(date_str):
    return datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB connection
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongodb_db['lineitem']

# Query lineitems within the specified timeframe from MongoDB
start_date = parse_date("1995-09-01")
end_date = parse_date("1995-09-30")

lineitems = list(lineitem_collection.find({'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lte': end_date}}))
lineitem_ids = [item['L_PARTKEY'] for item in lineitems]

# Query parts with 'PROMO' types from MySQL
promo_query = "SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part WHERE P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%'"
mysql_cursor.execute(promo_query)
promo_parts = [row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]

# Close all database connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()

# Calculate promotional revenue and total revenue
promo_revenue = 0
total_revenue = 0
for lineitem in lineitems:
    extended_price = lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE']
    discount = lineitem['L_DISCOUNT']
    discounted_price = extended_price * (1 - discount)
    
    if lineitem['L_PARTKEY'] in promo_parts:
        promo_revenue += discounted_price
    
    total_revenue += discounted_price

# Write results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Promotional Revenue', 'Total Revenue', 'Promotional Revenue (%)'])
    
    if total_revenue > 0:
        promo_revenue_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100
    else:
        promo_revenue_percentage = 0
    
    writer.writerow([promo_revenue, total_revenue, promo_revenue_percentage])
```

And here is a bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash script to install dependencies for running the Python code

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip for Python if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
