This analysis spans the time period from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1994. The calculation of revenue considers the extended price of line items, accounting for applicable discounts.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'customer,' 'orders,' 'lineitem,' 'supplier,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between customers, orders, line items, suppliers, and their respective nations and regions. Only data related to the 'ASIA' region is considered, determined by matching nation and region keys. The time frame is further constrained by including only orders placed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1994.\n\nThe results are then grouped by nation name, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation across different nations within the 'ASIA' region. The grouping is based on the total revenue for each nation, calculated by summing the extended price of line items after discount adjustments.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue, providing a detailed breakdown showcasing the nations in the 'ASIA' region, their respective total revenues, and how they contribute to the overall revenue picture during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the `python` code to execute the query and combine the data from both `mysql` and `mongodb`:

**query.py**
```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch',
)

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Prepare the data structures for the result
nation_revenue = {}

# Query and process MySQL data (Nation and Region tables)
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    # SQL to join nation and region and filter on 'ASIA'
    sql = """
    SELECT n.N_NAME, n.N_NATIONKEY
    FROM nation n
    JOIN region r ON n.N_REGIONKEY = r.R_REGIONKEY
    WHERE r.R_NAME = 'ASIA'
    """
    cursor.execute(sql)
    for nation_name, nation_key in cursor:
        nation_revenue[nation_key] = {'nation_name': nation_name, 'revenue': 0}

# Processing MongoDB data
# Getting customers from 'ASIA'
customers = list(mongodb.customer.find(
    {'C_NATIONKEY': {'$in': list(nation_revenue.keys())}},
    {'C_CUSTKEY': 1, 'C_NATIONKEY': 1}
))
# Maps customer key to nation key
customer_to_nation = {customer['C_CUSTKEY']: customer['C_NATIONKEY'] for customer in customers}

# Relevant orders based on timeframe
start_date = datetime(1990, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(1994, 12, 31)
orders = list(mongodb.orders.find(
    {'O_CUSTKEY': {'$in': list(customer_to_nation.keys())}, 'O_ORDERDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lte': end_date}},
    {'O_ORDERKEY': 1, 'O_CUSTKEY': 1}
))
# Maps order key to customer key
order_to_customer = {order['O_ORDERKEY']: order['O_CUSTKEY'] for order in orders}

# Line item records processing
line_items = mongodb.lineitem.find(
    {'L_ORDERKEY': {'$in': list(order_to_customer.keys())}},
    {'L_ORDERKEY': 1, 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE': 1, 'L_DISCOUNT': 1}
)
for line_item in line_items:
    order_key = line_item['L_ORDERKEY']
    # Calculate revenue
    revenue = line_item['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - line_item['L_DISCOUNT'])
    customer_key = order_to_customer[order_key]
    nation_key = customer_to_nation[customer_key]
    nation_revenue[nation_key]['revenue'] += revenue

# Sort results based on revenue
sorted_nations = sorted(nation_revenue.values(), key=lambda x: x['revenue'], reverse=True)

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['nation_name', 'revenue']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    for record in sorted_nations:
        writer.writerow(record)

# Close the connections
mysql_connection.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here's the `bash` script to install all dependencies to run the python code:

**setup.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package repository
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MongoDB and MySQL Python drivers
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
