The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the requested Python code that will fetch and combine data from the different databases to fulfill the query requirements:

```python
# Python Code to execute the query (`query.py`)

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
    charset='utf8mb4',
    cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor
)

# Connect to the MongoDB database
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Cursors for executing MySQL queries
mysql_cursor = mysql_connection.cursor()

# Query to get suppliers from Saudi Arabia
mysql_cursor.execute("""
SELECT S_NAME, S_SUPPKEY
FROM supplier
JOIN nation ON supplier.S_NATIONKEY = nation.N_NATIONKEY
WHERE N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
""")

# Mapping of supplier names to supplier keys for those located in SA
supplier_data = {supp_key: supp_name for supp_name, supp_key in mysql_cursor.fetchall()}

# Now, query MongoDB for orders with status 'F' and related line item details
matching_lineitems = mongodb['lineitem'].aggregate([
    {
        '$lookup': {
            'from': 'orders',
            'localField': 'L_ORDERKEY',
            'foreignField': 'O_ORDERKEY',
            'as': 'order_info'
        }
    },
    {'$unwind': '$order_info'},
    {'$match': {'order_info.O_ORDERSTATUS': 'F', 'L_RECEIPTDATE': {'$gt': '$L_COMMITDATE'}}},
    {
        '$project': {

            'L_ORDERKEY': 1,
            'L_RECEIPTDATE': 1,
            'L_COMMITDATE': 1,
            'order_info.O_ORDERSTATUS': 1
        }
    }
])

# Calculate waiting times
waiting_times = {}
for item in matching_lineitems:
    supp_key = item['L_SUPPKEY']
    if supp_key in supplier_data:
        waiting_times.setdefault(supp_key, 0)
        if item['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > item['L_COMMITDATE']:
            waiting_times[supp_key] += 1  # Increase count if criteria meet

# Write output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
    fieldnames = ['S_NAME', 'NUMWAIT']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    for supp_key, num_wait in sorted(waiting_times.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], supplier_data[x[0]])):
        writer.writerow({'S_NAME': supplier_data[supp_key], 'NUMWAIT': num_wait})

# Close the connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_connection.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And the requested bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# Bash script (`install_deps.sh`) to install dependencies

#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and Pip if not already present
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please ensure to give execution permissions to your bash script using `chmod +x install_deps.sh` command before running it.
