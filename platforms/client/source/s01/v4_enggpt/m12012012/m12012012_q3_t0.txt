The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested:

```python

with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    customers = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert to DataFrame

              .agg({'REVENUE': 'sum'})
              .reset_index())

# Sort the grouped results as specified
sorted_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write output to a CSV file
sorted_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close all the connections
mysql_conn.close()

```
