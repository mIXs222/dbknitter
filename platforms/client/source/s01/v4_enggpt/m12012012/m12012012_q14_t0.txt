The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the shipping date falls between September 1, 1995, and September 30, 1995. The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code (save it as `execute_query.py`):

```python
# Import Libraries
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL Connection and Query
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', passwd='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
query_mysql = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_TYPE
FROM part
WHERE P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%%'
"""
part_df = pd.read_sql(query_mysql, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Redis Connection and Query
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_str = redis_conn.get('lineitem')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(lineitem_str)

# Filter lineitem DataFrame by dates
start_date = datetime.strptime('1995-09-01', '%Y-%m-%d')
end_date = datetime.strptime('1995-09-30', '%Y-%m-%d')
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) & (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= end_date)]

# Merging to have only promo parts
promo_parts_lineitem_df = pd.merge(filtered_lineitem_df, part_df, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the promotional and total revenue
promo_parts_lineitem_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'] = promo_parts_lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - promo_parts_lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate the metrics
promo_revenue = promo_parts_lineitem_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'].sum()
total_revenue = filtered_lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()

# Promo revenue percentage
promo_revenue_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Save the output
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'Promo_Revenue_Percentage': [promo_revenue_percentage]})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is your bash script to install all dependencies (save it as `setup.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis and Redis
pip3 install direct_redis redis
```

Don't forget to give execution permissions to your bash script by running `chmod +x setup.sh` before executing it.
