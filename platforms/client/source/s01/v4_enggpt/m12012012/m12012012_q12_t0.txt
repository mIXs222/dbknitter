The analysis distinguishes between high-priority ('1-URGENT' and '2-HIGH') and low-priority orders. The results aim to provide a count of line items for each shipping mode falling into these priority categories.\n\nData is sourced from the 'orders' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing a relationship between orders and their corresponding line items. The criteria for selection include matching order and line item keys, specific shipping modes ('MAIL' and 'SHIP'), and ensuring that the commitment date is earlier than the receipt date, the shipping date is earlier than the commitment date, and the receipt date falls between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994.\n\nTwo counts are calculated for each shipping mode:\n\n'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\n'LOW_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders not marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\nThe results are then grouped by shipping mode, offering insights into the distribution of line items based on shipping modes and order priorities. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the shipping mode, providing a comprehensive view of line item counts categorized by shipping mode and order priority.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

**query_script.py**
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host="mongodb", port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from MongoDB
orders_query = {
    "O_ORDERDATE": {
        "$gte": datetime(1994, 1, 1),
        "$lte": datetime(1994, 12, 31)
    },
    "O_ORDERPRIORITY": {
        "$in": ["1-URGENT", "2-HIGH"]
    }
}
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_collection.find(orders_query, projection={"_id": 0})))
orders_df.set_index('O_ORDERKEY', inplace=True)

# Fetch data from Redis
lineitems_raw = redis.get('lineitem')
lineitems_df = pd.read_json(lineitems_raw, orient='records')
lineitems_df.set_index('L_ORDERKEY', inplace=True)

# Merge data
merged_df = lineitems_df.join(orders_df, how="inner", rsuffix='_order')

# Filter based on criteria and calculate counts
filtered_df = merged_df[
    (merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) &
    (filtered_df['L_COMMITDATE'] < filtered_df['L_RECEIPTDATE']) &
    (filtered_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < filtered_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
]

# Count line items for high and low priority
shipping_modes = filtered_df['L_SHIPMODE'].unique()
results = []
for mode in shipping_modes:
    high_priority_count = filtered_df[
        (filtered_df['L_SHIPMODE'] == mode) &
        (filtered_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].isin(['1-URGENT', '2-HIGH']))
    ].shape[0]
    low_priority_count = filtered_df[
        (filtered_df['L_SHIPMODE'] == mode) &
        (~filtered_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].isin(['1-URGENT', '2-HIGH']))
    ].shape[0]
    results.append({'SHIPPING_MODE': mode, 'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': high_priority_count, 'LOW_LINE_COUNT': low_priority_count})

# Create the results DataFrame
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
results_df.sort_values('SHIPPING_MODE', ascending=True, inplace=True)

# Write to CSV
results_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now the bash script to install all dependencies:

**install_dependencies.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assuming this script is running in an environment with Python3 and pip installed.

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python MongoDB client (pymongo)
pip3 install pymongo

# Install DirectRedis, for direct communication with Redis
pip3 install direct_redis

# Install Pandas, required for data manipulation
pip3 install pandas

echo "All dependencies have been installed."
```
Remember to make the bash script executable with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
