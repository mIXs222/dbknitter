The analysis considers not just the number of orders but incorporates a nuanced criterion. Only orders with associated line items where the commitment date precedes the receipt date are included in the count.\n\nFor each order priority, calculate the count of such orders meeting the aforementioned conditions. This detailed examination aims to provide a granular understanding of how order priorities are distributed, taking into account the temporal constraints and the commitment-receipt date relationship of associated line items.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the order priority, offering a clear and insightful portrayal of order priorities and their counts within the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query.py`) you requested to execute the query on your original data:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_lineitem_collection = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# Redis connection setup
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

def get_orders_from_redis():
    orders_str = redis_client.get('orders')
    if orders_str:
        orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_str, orient='records')
        return orders_df
    else:
        return pd.DataFrame()

def get_lineitems_from_mongo():
    query = {
        "L_COMMITDATE": {"$lt": "L_RECEIPTDATE"},
        "L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte": datetime(1993, 7, 1)},
        "L_SHIPDATE": {"$lte": datetime(1993, 10, 1)}
    }
    projection = {"L_ORDERKEY": 1}
    lineitems_cursor = mongo_lineitem_collection.find(query, projection)
    lineitems_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitems_cursor))
    return lineitems_df

def main():
    # Retrieve data from Redis and MongoDB
    orders_df = get_orders_from_redis()
    lineitems_df = get_lineitems_from_mongo()

    # Join the dataframes on order key
    result_df = pd.merge(orders_df, lineitems_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY', how='inner')

    # Perform the analysis based on the conditions and group by order priority
    final_df = result_df.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY').size().reset_index(name='order_count')

    # Sorting the final result as per the order priority
    final_df.sort_values('O_ORDERPRIORITY', inplace=True)

    # Write the final dataframe to CSV
    final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python MongoDB driver
pip install pymongo

# Install Pandas for data manipulation
pip install pandas

# Install the Redis client
pip install direct-redis

# You may want to run the script with `bash install_dependencies.sh`
```

Ensure you give the Bash script execution permission by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
