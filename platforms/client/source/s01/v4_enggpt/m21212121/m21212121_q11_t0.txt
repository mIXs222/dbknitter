The analysis considers the supply cost and available quantity for each part. The results aim to identify parts where the total value (calculated as the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity) exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'partsupp,' 'supplier,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, and nations. The focus is specifically on suppliers in Germany ('N_NAME' is 'GERMANY').\n\nThe results are grouped by part key, and a filtering condition ('HAVING') is applied to select only those groups where the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity surpasses a certain percentage of the overall value for Germany-based suppliers. This threshold is calculated in a subquery.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the calculated value, providing insights into the parts with the highest values that meet the specified conditions for suppliers in Germany.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (.py) that fetches and combines the data from MongoDB and Redis, and then performs the described analysis:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import json

# Connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
supplier_collection = mongo_db['supplier']

# Connection to Redis
import direct_redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)

# Fetch data from MongoDB
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Fetch data from Redis and convert JSON to DataFrame
nation_data = json.loads(redis_client.get('nation'))
partsupp_data = json.loads(redis_client.get('partsupp'))

nation_df = pd.DataFrame(nation_data)
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(partsupp_data)

# Merge dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(supplier_df, nation_df, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, partsupp_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='PS_SUPPKEY')

# Filter suppliers located in Germany
germany_suppliers = merged_df[merged_df['N_NAME'] == 'GERMANY']

# Calculate total value for each part
germany_suppliers['TOTAL_VALUE'] = germany_suppliers['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * germany_suppliers['PS_AVAILQTY']

# Compute the threshold for Germany-based suppliers
threshold_value = germany_suppliers['TOTAL_VALUE'].sum() * 0.01  # Assuming the threshold is 1% of total value

# Group by part key
grouped_data = germany_suppliers.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').agg(
    TOTAL_VALUE_GROUPED=('TOTAL_VALUE', 'sum')
)
filtered_parts = grouped_data[grouped_data['TOTAL_VALUE_GROUPED'] > threshold_value]

# Sort the values and write to CSV
final_output = filtered_parts.sort_values('TOTAL_VALUE_GROUPED', ascending=False)
final_output.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

And here's the Bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip and Python dev tools
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Please make sure to execute the bash script with appropriate permissions to install the necessary packages.
