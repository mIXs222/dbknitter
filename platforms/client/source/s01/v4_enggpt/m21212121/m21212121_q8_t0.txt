The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the year of the order and the calculated market share, specifically focusing on the nation 'INDIA.'\n\nTo achieve this, data is derived from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between parts, suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations and regions. The focus is on the 'ASIA' region and the specific part type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER.'\n\nFor each order, the volume is calculated as the extended price of line items adjusted for discounts. The volume is associated with the respective nation, considering the 'INDIA' nation. The results are then grouped by the year of the order.\n\nThe market share is computed by summing the volumes associated with 'INDIA' and dividing it by the total volume. This provides a detailed understanding of the market share dynamics for the specified part type within the 'ASIA' region, specifically highlighting the contribution of 'INDIA' over the years 1995 and 1996.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of market share trends for the 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' part in the 'ASIA' region during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`query.py`) to execute the described query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Load MongoDB tables
region_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['region'].find()))
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['supplier'].find()))
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['customer'].find()))
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['lineitem'].find()))

# Load Redis tables
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('nation').decode())
part_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('part').decode())
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('orders').decode())

# Filter the data
part_df = part_df[part_df['P_TYPE'] == 'SMALL PLATED COPPER']
asian_nations = nation_df[nation_df['N_REGIONKEY'] == region_df[region_df['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA']['R_REGIONKEY'].iloc[0]]
indian_nation = asian_nations[asian_nations['N_NAME'] == 'INDIA']

# Merge the tables
filtered_lineitems = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(part_df['P_PARTKEY'])]
filtered_supplier = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(asian_nations['N_NATIONKEY'])]

filtered_df = (
    filtered_lineitems
    .merge(filtered_supplier, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
    .merge(orders_df, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')
    .merge(customer_df, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
)

# Compute the volume and filter by years 1995 and 1996
filtered_df['L_VOLUME'] = filtered_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
filtered_df['YEAR'] = filtered_df['L_SHIPDATE'].apply(lambda x: datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d').year)
filtered_df = filtered_df[(filtered_df['YEAR'] == 1995) | (filtered_df['YEAR'] == 1996)]

# Calculate market share
total_volume_by_year = filtered_df.groupby('YEAR')['L_VOLUME'].sum().reset_index()
india_volume_by_year = filtered_df[filtered_df['C_NATIONKEY'].isin(indian_nation['N_NATIONKEY'])].groupby('YEAR')['L_VOLUME'].sum().reset_index()
market_share_by_year = india_volume_by_year.merge(total_volume_by_year, on='YEAR')
market_share_by_year['MARKET_SHARE'] = market_share_by_year['L_VOLUME_x'] / market_share_by_year['L_VOLUME_y']

# Select only relevant columns and sort
market_share_by_year = market_share_by_year[['YEAR', 'MARKET_SHARE']].sort_values('YEAR')

# Write to CSV
market_share_by_year.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip and Python dev tools
apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install MongoDB driver `pymongo`
pip3 install pymongo

# Install `direct_redis` for Redis connection
pip3 install git+https://github.com/RedisLabs/direct_redis.git

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
