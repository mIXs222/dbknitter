The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you can use to execute the described query:

```python
# Python code to execute the complex multi-database query
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import direct_redis

# Function to get the dataframe from Redis
def get_redis_df(redis_client, table_name):
    data = redis_client.get(table_name)
    if data:
        return pd.read_json(data)
    else:
        return pd.DataFrame()

# Connecting to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = client["tpch"]
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.supplier.find({})))
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.lineitem.find({})))

# Connecting to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
nation_df = get_redis_df(redis_client, 'nation')
orders_df = get_redis_df(redis_client, 'orders')

# Process the query
# Filter the nations for 'SAUDI ARABIA'
saudi_suppliers = nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'SAUDI ARABIA']['N_NATIONKEY'].unique()

# Filter suppliers based on location
suppliers_in_saudi = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(saudi_suppliers)]

# Join suppliers with lineitem
suppliers_lineitems = suppliers_in_saudi.merge(lineitem_df, how='inner', left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='L_SUPPKEY')

# Join the result with orders
suppliers_orders = suppliers_lineitems.merge(orders_df, how='inner', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Final filtering according to the specified conditions
result_df = suppliers_orders[
    (suppliers_orders['O_ORDERSTATUS'] == 'F') &
    (suppliers_orders['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > suppliers_orders['L_COMMITDATE'])
].groupby('S_NAME').agg(NUMWAIT=('L_ORDERKEY', 'count')).reset_index()

# Result ordering
result_df = result_df.sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])

# Writing to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Below is the Bash script to install all Python dependencies required to execute the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash script to set up the Python environment for the query execution

# Update the package list and install Python pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis

# Install DirectRedis (assuming DirectRedis is available as Python package
# If there is any specific command to install DirectRedis, replace the following line with the correct one
pip3 install direct-redis

# Check if the packages are successfully installed
pip3 list
```

Please ensure that you replace `direct-redis` installation line with the correct command if it has a specific installation procedure. Since it's not a standard library, you may need to perform different actions to install it.
