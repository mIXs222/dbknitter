Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (.py) that fulfills the user's request:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from bson.regex import Regex
import direct_redis

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = client["tpch"]

# Query lineitem table
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.lineitem.find({
    "L_SHIPMODE": Regex(r'.*')  # Assuming we want to load all documents, this is a workaround for MongoDB
}, {
    "_id": 0, 
    "L_PARTKEY": 1, 
    "L_QUANTITY": 1,
    "L_EXTENDEDPRICE": 1
})))

# Connect to Redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query part table
part_df = pd.read_json(r.get('part'))

# Filtering for 'Brand#23' and 'MED BAG'
part_df = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Merging lineitem and part dataframe on part key
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate average quantity for each part
part_avg_quantity = merged_df.groupby('P_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()

# Calculate 20% of average quantity for each part
part_avg_quantity['qty_20_percent'] = part_avg_quantity['L_QUANTITY'] * 0.2

# Join with merged_df to filter further based on L_QUANTITY < 20% of avg quantity
final_df = pd.merge(merged_df, part_avg_quantity[['P_PARTKEY', 'qty_20_percent']], on='P_PARTKEY')
final_df = final_df[final_df['L_QUANTITY'] < final_df['qty_20_percent']]

# Calculate average yearly extended price
final_df['avg_yearly_ext_price'] = final_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] / 7.0

# Output result
final_result = final_df.groupby('P_PARTKEY')['avg_yearly_ext_price'].mean().reset_index()
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is the Bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MongoDB dependencies
apt-get install -y libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev

# Upgrade pip and install the Python packages
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install pymongo pandas

# Install direct_redis (assuming it's a custom package, typically it would be `redis-py`, but following instructions)
# This step may fail if direct_redis is not available in PyPI repositories, this is just a template.
pip3 install direct_redis
``` 

Please make sure to adjust the installation steps for `direct_redis` according to how it's actually distributed and installed, as no standard `direct_redis` package is available at the time of writing. The script assumes `direct_redis` is the correct package name provided, otherwise, the real package should be used.
