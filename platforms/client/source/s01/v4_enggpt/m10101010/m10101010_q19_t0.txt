This python code (named `query.py`) should be placed in your project directory. Now, here's the bash script to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and upgrade existing packages
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

# Install pip if it's not already available
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the Python libraries required for the script
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

This bash script needs to have executable permissions set by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before it can be executed. Make sure you run this with sufficient permissions (typically as root or using `sudo`).
