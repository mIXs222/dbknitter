The criteria for inclusion involve the following:\n\nSelection of orders where the order key is in the set of order keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery identifies order keys with a total quantity of items exceeding 300.\nMatching customer key in orders and line items.\nMatching order key in orders and line items.\nThe subquery calculates the total quantity of items per order key and selects only those order keys where the total quantity exceeds 300.\n\nThe main query then retrieves information such as customer name ('C_NAME'), customer key ('C_CUSTKEY'), order key ('O_ORDERKEY'), order date ('O_ORDERDATE'), total price of the order ('O_TOTALPRICE'), and the sum of quantities of items in the line items associated with each order.\n\nThe results are grouped by customer name, customer key, order key, order date, and total price. The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the total price of the order and then by order date. This ordering provides a detailed view of customer orders meeting the specified quantity criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's a Python script to execute the mentioned analysis by fetching data from MySQL and MongoDB, and combining the results:

```python
# analysis.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Define connection parameters for MySQL
mysql_conn_params = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch'
}

# Establish connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_params)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Perform subquery in MySQL to get order keys with total quantity over 300
mysql_cursor.execute('''
    SELECT L_ORDERKEY, SUM(L_QUANTITY) as total_quantity
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY
    HAVING total_quantity > 300;
''')

# Fetch the results
order_keys_with_high_qty = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Convert results into a list of order keys
high_qty_order_keys = [row[0] for row in order_keys_with_high_qty]

# Close the MySQL connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Define connection parameters for MongoDB
mongodb_conn_params = {
    'host': 'mongodb',
    'port': 27017
}

# Establish connection to MongoDB
mongodb_conn = pymongo.MongoClient(**mongodb_conn_params)
mongodb_db = mongodb_conn['tpch']
orders_collection = mongodb_db['orders']

# Perform query in MongoDB to get orders matching the high quantity order keys
orders_with_high_qty = list(orders_collection.find({
    'O_ORDERKEY': {'$in': high_qty_order_keys}
}, {
    'O_ORDERKEY': 1, 'O_CUSTKEY': 1, 'O_ORDERDATE': 1, 'O_TOTALPRICE': 1
}))

# Convert MongoDB results to a dictionary for easy lookup
orders_dict = {order['O_ORDERKEY']: order for order in orders_with_high_qty}

# Establish connection to MySQL to fetch customer details
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_params)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    # Write Header
    writer.writerow(['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'TOTAL_QUANTITY'])

    # Iterate through order keys with high quantities
    for order_key in high_qty_order_keys:
        # Ensure the order exists in the orders_dict
        if order_key not in orders_dict:
            continue

        order = orders_dict[order_key]

        # Fetch customer information matching the order's customer key
        mysql_cursor.execute('''
            SELECT C_NAME, C_CUSTKEY
            FROM customer
            WHERE C_CUSTKEY = %s
        ''', (order['O_CUSTKEY'],))

        # Fetch customer data from MySQL
        customer_data = mysql_cursor.fetchone()

        # Write a row with the combined data
        writer.writerow([
            customer_data[0],  # C_NAME
            customer_data[1],  # C_CUSTKEY
            order['O_ORDERKEY'],  # O_ORDERKEY
            order['O_ORDERDATE'],  # O_ORDERDATE
            order['O_TOTALPRICE'],  # O_TOTALPRICE
            sum([li[1] for li in high_qty_order_keys if li[0] == order_key])  # TOTAL_QUANTITY
        ])

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Close MongoDB connection
mongodb_conn.close()
```

And here's the Bash script for installing dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories and upgrade the system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
