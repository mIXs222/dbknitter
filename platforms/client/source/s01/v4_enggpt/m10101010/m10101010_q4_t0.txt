The analysis considers not just the number of orders but incorporates a nuanced criterion. Only orders with associated line items where the commitment date precedes the receipt date are included in the count.\n\nFor each order priority, calculate the count of such orders meeting the aforementioned conditions. This detailed examination aims to provide a granular understanding of how order priorities are distributed, taking into account the temporal constraints and the commitment-receipt date relationship of associated line items.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the order priority, offering a clear and insightful portrayal of order priorities and their counts within the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here's the Python code (`query.py`) required to execute the query:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Start with the mongodb orders that fall within the given timeframe
start_time = datetime(1993, 7, 1)
end_time = datetime(1993, 10, 1)
orders = list(mongodb_db.orders.find({
    "O_ORDERDATE": {"$gte": start_time, "$lt": end_time}
}, {"_id": 0, "O_ORDERKEY": 1, "O_ORDERPRIORITY": 1}))

# Filter the orders based on the MySQL lineitem commit and receipt dates
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    order_keys = [order["O_ORDERKEY"] for order in orders]
    format_strings = ','.join(['%s'] * len(order_keys))
    cursor.execute(f"""
        SELECT L_ORDERKEY
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE AND L_ORDERKEY IN ({format_strings})
    """, tuple(order_keys))
    valid_order_keys = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

# Extract final order priorities and counts
result = {}
for order in orders:
    if order['O_ORDERKEY'] in valid_order_keys:
        priority = order['O_ORDERPRIORITY']
        if priority not in result:
            result[priority] = 0
        result[priority] += 1

# Sort results by order priority
sorted_result = sorted(result.items())

# Write to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
    writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
    writer.writerow(['O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'COUNT'])
    for priority, count in sorted_result:
        writer.writerow([priority, count])

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

2. And here's a bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Ensure pip is installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
