The analysis distinguishes between customers who have placed orders with specific conditions and those who haven't. The results aim to provide insights into the distribution of customers based on the count of their orders and the presence of certain keywords in the order comments.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer' and 'orders' tables, utilizing a left outer join to ensure all customers are included, regardless of whether they have placed orders or not. The conditions for joining include matching customer and order keys, and the exclusion of orders with comments containing the phrases 'pending' and 'deposits.'\n\nWithin the subquery ('C_ORDERS'), for each customer, the count of orders meeting the specified conditions is calculated.\n\nThe outer query then groups the results by the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). For each count, it calculates the number of customers ('CUSTDIST') with that specific count of orders. The results provide a distribution of customers based on their order counts.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of customers ('CUSTDIST') and, in the case of ties, in descending order based on the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). This ordering offers a comprehensive view of the distribution of customers based on their order counts and the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
