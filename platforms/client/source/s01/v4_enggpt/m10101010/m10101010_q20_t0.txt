The analysis involves multiple nested subqueries and focuses on suppliers located in Canada ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers and nations. The main selection criteria are defined within a set of subqueries:\n\nIdentify suppliers whose supplier keys ('S_SUPPKEY') are in the set of supplier keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery filters suppliers based on parts available in specific conditions.\nThe second subquery identifies part keys ('PS_PARTKEY') from the 'partsupp' table where the associated part names ('P_NAME') start with 'forest.'\nThe third subquery calculates a threshold quantity as 50% of the sum of line item quantities for a specific part-supplier combination, meeting additional conditions like a specific ship date range ('L_SHIPDATE' between '1994-01-01' and '1995-01-01').\nThe main query filters suppliers based on the specified nation ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and addresses ('S_ADDRESS') for suppliers meeting the specified conditions, ordered in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
