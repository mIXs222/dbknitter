Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the required operation:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
part_collection = mongo_db['part']

# Get qualifying part keys from MongoDB
qualifying_parts = part_collection.find({'P_BRAND': 'Brand#23', 'P_CONTAINER': 'MED BAG'}, {'P_PARTKEY': 1})
part_keys = [part['P_PARTKEY'] for part in qualifying_parts]

# If no qualifying parts, exit the script
if not part_keys:
    print('No qualifying parts found.')
    exit()

# Convert part keys to a format suitable for the IN clause in SQL
part_keys_str = ','.join(map(str, part_keys))

# MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT L_PARTKEY, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly_extended_price
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_PARTKEY IN (%s) AND L_QUANTITY < (SELECT 0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY) FROM lineitem WHERE L_PARTKEY = lineitem.L_PARTKEY)
GROUP BY L_PARTKEY;
""" % part_keys_str
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)
results = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Write to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    result_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    result_writer.writerow(['L_PARTKEY', 'avg_yearly_extended_price'])  # Header
    result_writer.writerows(results)

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies to run that Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade existing packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to give execute permissions to your bash script before running it using `chmod +x your_script.sh`.
