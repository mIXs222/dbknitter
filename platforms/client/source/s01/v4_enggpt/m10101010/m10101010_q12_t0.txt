The criteria for selection include matching order and line item keys, specific shipping modes ('MAIL' and 'SHIP'), and ensuring that the commitment date is earlier than the receipt date, the shipping date is earlier than the commitment date, and the receipt date falls between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994.\n\nTwo counts are calculated for each shipping mode:\n\n'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\n'LOW_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders not marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\nThe results are then grouped by shipping mode, offering insights into the distribution of line items based on shipping modes and order priorities. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the shipping mode, providing a comprehensive view of line item counts categorized by shipping mode and order priority.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code that achieves the query using data from MySQL and MongoDB, and writes the results to `query_output.csv`.

### Python Code (`query.py`)
```python
import csv
import pymysql
import pymongo
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongo_db.orders

# Extract necessary 'orders' from MongoDB
high_priority = ['1-URGENT', '2-HIGH']
start_date = datetime(1994, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(1994, 12, 31)
orders = list(orders_collection.find(
    {'$and': [
        {'O_ORDERDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lte': end_date}},
        {'O_ORDERPRIORITY': {'$in': high_priority + ['OTHER']}}
    ]},
    {'_id': 0, 'O_ORDERKEY': 1, 'O_ORDERPRIORITY': 1}
))

# Convert MongoDB orders to a format compatible with MySQL
orders_map = {}
for order in orders:
    key = order['O_ORDERKEY']
    priority = 'HIGH' if order['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] in high_priority else 'LOW'
    orders_map[key] = priority

# Query the 'lineitem' table in MySQL
shipping_modes = ['MAIL', 'SHIP']
results = []
for mode in shipping_modes:
    mysql_cursor.execute("""
        SELECT L_SHIPMODE, COUNT(*) as count, %s as priority
        FROM lineitem 
        WHERE L_SHIPMODE = %s 
        AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE 
        AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE 
        AND L_RECEIPTDATE BETWEEN %s AND %s
        GROUP BY L_SHIPMODE
    """, (mode, mode, start_date, end_date))
    mode_counts = {'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': 0, 'LOW_LINE_COUNT': 0}
    for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall():
        order_key = row[0]
        count = row[1]
        priority = orders_map.get(order_key, 'LOW')
        line_count_key = f"{priority}_LINE_COUNT"
        mode_counts[line_count_key] += count
    results.append((mode, mode_counts['HIGH_LINE_COUNT'], mode_counts['LOW_LINE_COUNT']))

# Write the query results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['SHIPMODE', 'HIGH_LINE_COUNT', 'LOW_LINE_COUNT'])
    for row in results:
        writer.writerow(row)

# Closing connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

### Bash Script (`setup.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install the required Python libraries
pip install pymysql pymongo
```

Please ensure you have Python installed on your system and `pip` available for installing dependencies. The above bash script assumes a Unix-like environment with a standard Python installation. Make both files executable by running `chmod +x query.py setup.sh` before executing them.
