The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the requested Python code (e.g., `data_analysis.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get parts data from MongoDB
parts_query = {
    'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'},
    'P_TYPE': {'$not': {'$regex': '^MEDIUM POLISHED'}},
    'P_SIZE': {'$in': [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]}
}
part_projection = {'_id': 0}
parts = mongodb['part'].find(parts_query, part_projection)

# Convert MongoDB parts to a list of dicts, for use in the MySQL query
valid_parts = list(parts)

# Prepare MySQL query
supplier_query = """
SELECT S_SUPPKEY 
FROM supplier
WHERE S_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%Customer Complaints%'
"""

# Execute MySQL query for valid suppliers
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(supplier_query)
    valid_suppliers = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert valid suppliers to a s
et for faster lookups
valid_supplier_keys = {s['S_SUPPKEY'] for s in valid_suppliers}

# Prepare MongoDB query for partsupp with valid suppliers only
partsupp_query = {'PS_SUPPKEY': {'$in': list(valid_supplier_keys)}}
partsupp_projection = {'_id': 0}
partsupps = mongodb['partsupp'].find(partsupp_query, partsupp_projection)

# Join parts and partsupp based on the part key, count valid suppliers
results = []
for part in valid_parts:
    for partsupp in partsupps:
        if part['P_PARTKEY'] == partsupp['PS_PARTKEY']:
            results.append({'P_BRAND': part['P_BRAND'],
                            'P_TYPE': part['P_TYPE'],
                            'P_SIZE': part['P_SIZE'],
                            'SUPPLIER_CNT': partsupp['PS_SUPPKEY']})

# Sort results
results.sort(key=lambda x: (-x['SUPPLIER_CNT'], x['P_BRAND'], x['P_TYPE'], x['P_SIZE']))

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'SUPPLIER_CNT']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    for result in results:
        writer.writerow(result)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

2. And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies (e.g., `setup.sh`):

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and PIP
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please note that the given code is for demonstration and instructional purposes. In a real-world scenario, the code might require adaptation and error handling for production use.
