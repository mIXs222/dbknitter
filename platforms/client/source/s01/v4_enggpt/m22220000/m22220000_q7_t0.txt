The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the supplier and customer nations, the year of shipping, and the calculated revenue volume.\n\nTo achieve this, data is extracted from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' and 'nation' tables. The relationship between suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations is established. Specifically, the nations involved are 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA,' considering both possible pairs: ('JAPAN' as the supplier nation and 'INDIA' as the customer nation, and vice versa).\n\nThe timeframe of interest for the line items is set between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996. For each line item, the revenue volume is computed as the extended price adjusted for the discount.\n\nThe results are then grouped by supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping. This detailed grouping provides insights into how revenue is distributed over the specified period across different nation pairs and shipping years.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping, offering a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics between suppliers and customers in 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA' during the specified timeframe\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Here is the bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update system and install Python 3 if necessary
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# direct_redis should be manually installed if it's not available through pip.
# Manual installation steps would depend on how the module can be obtained.

# For example, if direct_redis is available via git, you can clone and install like this:
# git clone https://github.com/your/direct_redis.git
# cd direct_redis
# python3 setup.py install

# Note: The above lines are placeholders as the real installation process for `direct_redis` 
# would depend on how it's distributed which is not specified in the problem statement.
```

Make sure that `install_dependencies.sh` has execution permissions before you run it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

To run the bash script, you'd simply execute the following in your terminal:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
