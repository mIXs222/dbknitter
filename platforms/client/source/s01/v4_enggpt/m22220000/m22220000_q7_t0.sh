pip3 install pymysql pandas

# direct_redis should be manually installed if it's not available through pip.
# Manual installation steps would depend on how the module can be obtained.

# For example, if direct_redis is available via git, you can clone and install like this:
# git clone https://github.com/your/direct_redis.git
# cd direct_redis
# python3 setup.py install

# Note: The above lines are placeholders as the real installation process for `direct_redis` 
# would depend on how it's distributed which is not specified in the problem statement.
