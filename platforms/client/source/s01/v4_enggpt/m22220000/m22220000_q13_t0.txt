Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct a thorough analysis of customer order counts and their distribution. The analysis distinguishes between customers who have placed orders with specific conditions and those who haven't. The results aim to provide insights into the distribution of customers based on the count of their orders and the presence of certain keywords in the order comments.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer' and 'orders' tables, utilizing a left outer join to ensure all customers are included, regardless of whether they have placed orders or not. The conditions for joining include matching customer and order keys, and the exclusion of orders with comments containing the phrases 'pending' and 'deposits.'\n\nWithin the subquery ('C_ORDERS'), for each customer, the count of orders meeting the specified conditions is calculated.\n\nThe outer query then groups the results by the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). For each count, it calculates the number of customers ('CUSTDIST') with that specific count of orders. The results provide a distribution of customers based on their order counts.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of customers ('CUSTDIST') and, in the case of ties, in descending order based on the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). This ordering offers a comprehensive view of the distribution of customers based on their order counts and the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (.py) for executing the query:

```python
# mysql_query.py
import pymysql
import csv

# Connection information for MySQL
mysql_conn_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
    'charset': 'utf8mb4',
    'cursorclass': pymysql.cursors.Cursor
}

# Attempt to connect to the mysql database
try:
    mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_info)
    print("Connected to MySQL")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error connecting to MySQL: {e}")

try:
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Define the MySQL query
        query = """
        SELECT C_COUNT, COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST
        FROM (

            FROM customer C
            LEFT JOIN orders O ON C.C_CUSTKEY = O.O_CUSTKEY
            AND O.O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%' AND O.O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%deposits%'
            GROUP BY C.C_CUSTKEY
        ) AS C_ORDERS
        GROUP BY C_COUNT
        ORDER BY CUSTDIST DESC, C_COUNT DESC
        """

        # Execute the query
        cursor.execute(query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write output to csv file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:

            # Write header
            csvwriter.writerow(['C_COUNT', 'CUSTDIST'])
            for row in results:

Below is the Bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run the above python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and upgrade existing packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python3 and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql
```

To execute these scripts, you would:

1. Save the Python code in a file named `mysql_query.py`.
2. Save the Bash script in a file named `install_dependencies.sh`.
3. Run the Bash script to install dependencies (you might need to grant execution permission with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`).
4. Run the Python code with `python3 mysql_query.py`.
