The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the python code to execute the query:

```python
# File: query.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import direct_redis

#### MySQL Connection ####
mysql_conn_info = {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "host": "mysql",
    "database": "tpch"
}

# Establish a connection to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_info)

# SQL Query to get partsupp data from MySQL
partsupp_sql = """
SELECT PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY
FROM partsupp
"""

partsupp_df = pd.read_sql(partsupp_sql, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

#### Redis Connection ####
redis_host = 'redis'
redis_port = 6379

# Establish a connection to the Redis data store
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port)

# Get part and supplier data from Redis
part_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('part'))
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('supplier'))

# Pre-processing Redis DataFrames
# Convert columns to the correct data types
part_df = part_df.astype({'P_PARTKEY': int})
supplier_df = supplier_df.astype({'S_SUPPKEY': int})

# Filters for part dataframe
exclude_brands = ['Brand#45']
exclude_types = ['MEDIUM POLISHED']
include_sizes = [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]

part_df = part_df[
    (~part_df['P_BRAND'].isin(exclude_brands)) &
    (~part_df['P_TYPE'].str.startswith(tuple(exclude_types))) &
    (part_df['P_SIZE'].isin(include_sizes))
]

# Filter for supplier dataframe based on S_COMMENT
supplier_df = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Merge parts_df with partsupp_df
merged_df = pd.merge(part_df, partsupp_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')

# Merge the result with supplier_df
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, supplier_df, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Group by 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'
grouped = merged_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])

# Calculate SUPPLIER_CNT for each group
result_df = grouped['S_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index(name='SUPPLIER_CNT')

# Sort the result based on SUPPLIER_CNT (descending), P_BRAND, P_TYPE, and P_SIZE (ascending)
result_df = result_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Save result to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# File: install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pandas pymysql sqlalchemy direct-redis

# Make the python script executable
chmod +x query.py
```

Make sure you give the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) execution permission before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
