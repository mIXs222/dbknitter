Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: supplier\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- supplier: S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL, S_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nPerform an in-depth analysis of suppliers and their associated total revenue during a specific three-month period starting from January 1, 1996. The analysis focuses on line items, where the shipping date falls within this specified timeframe. The results aim to identify the supplier with the maximum total revenue during this period.\n\nIn the first part of the query, a Common Table Expression (CTE) named 'revenue0' is created. This CTE calculates the total revenue for each supplier ('SUPPLIER_NO') based on the sum of extended prices adjusted for discounts from relevant line items. The calculation is performed for line items with shipping dates between January 1, 1996, and March 31, 1996. The results are grouped by supplier.\n\nIn the second part of the query, the main selection is made from the 'supplier' table, along with the 'revenue0' CTE. The results include supplier information such as supplier key ('S_SUPPKEY'), name ('S_NAME'), address ('S_ADDRESS'), and phone number ('S_PHONE'), along with the total revenue calculated in the CTE. The selection is filtered to include only the supplier with the maximum total revenue during the specified timeframe.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the supplier key ('S_SUPPKEY'). This ordering provides a comprehensive view of supplier details for the supplier with the highest total revenue during the specified three-month period.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query across the two databases (MySQL and Redis):

```python
# The Python code (execute_query.py)
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Calculate revenue0 from MySQL lineitem table
mysql_cursor.execute("""
    SELECT L_SUPPKEY as SUPPLIER_NO, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as TOTAL_REVENUE
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1996-01-01' AND '1996-03-31'
    GROUP BY L_SUPPKEY;
""")
revenue0 = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cursor.fetchall(), columns=['SUPPLIER_NO', 'TOTAL_REVENUE'])

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch supplier data and convert to DataFrame
supplier_data = redis_conn.get('supplier')
supplier_df = pd.read_json(supplier_data)

# Merge revenue0 with supplier information
merged_data = pd.merge(supplier_df, revenue0, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='SUPPLIER_NO')

# Identify supplier with the maximum total revenue
max_rev_supplier = merged_data.loc[merged_data['TOTAL_REVENUE'].idxmax()]

# Save the result to CSV, considering only the supplier with max revenue
max_rev_supplier.to_frame().transpose().to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
```

This Python script requires connectivity to both MySQL and Redis databases, and it extracts and combines data from the given tables.

For the bash script to install dependencies:

```bash
# The Bash script (setup.sh)
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis
```

Make sure to grant execution permissions to the bash script before running it:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Now you can run the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Python code using:

```bash
python3 execute_query.py
```
