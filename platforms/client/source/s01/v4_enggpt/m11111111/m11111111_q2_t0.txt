message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: nation, region, part, supplier, partsupp\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- nation: N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME, N_REGIONKEY, N_COMMENT\n- region: R_REGIONKEY, R_NAME, R_COMMENT\n- part: P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT\n- supplier: S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL, S_COMMENT\n- partsupp: PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY, PS_AVAILQTY, PS_SUPPLYCOST, PS_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nRetrieve detailed information about suppliers, parts, and nations meeting specific criteria within the 'EUROPE' region. The analysis focuses on parts with a size of 15 and a type containing 'BRASS.' Additionally, the suppliers of these parts are located in the 'EUROPE' region. The results include the account balance, name, address, phone, and comments of the suppliers, as well as details about the parts, such as part key, manufacturer, and size.\n\nData is sourced from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'partsupp,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, partsuppliers, nations, and regions. The criteria for selection involve matching part and supplier keys, part size and type, supplier nation and region, and the minimum supply cost within the 'EUROPE' region.\n\nThe results are ordered in descending order based on the supplier's account balance, and then in ascending order based on nation name, supplier name, and part key. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of account balances among suppliers, organized by region, nation, supplier name, and part key.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
