message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct a thorough analysis of customer order counts and their distribution. The analysis distinguishes between customers who have placed orders with specific conditions and those who haven't. The results aim to provide insights into the distribution of customers based on the count of their orders and the presence of certain keywords in the order comments.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer' and 'orders' tables, utilizing a left outer join to ensure all customers are included, regardless of whether they have placed orders or not. The conditions for joining include matching customer and order keys, and the exclusion of orders with comments containing the phrases 'pending' and 'deposits.'\n\nWithin the subquery ('C_ORDERS'), for each customer, the count of orders meeting the specified conditions is calculated.\n\nThe outer query then groups the results by the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). For each count, it calculates the number of customers ('CUSTDIST') with that specific count of orders. The results provide a distribution of customers based on their order counts.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of customers ('CUSTDIST') and, in the case of ties, in descending order based on the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). This ordering offers a comprehensive view of the distribution of customers based on their order counts and the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (save as `query_analysis.py`):

```python
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to the MongoDB server
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')
db = client['tpch']

# Query the 'customer' collection and 'orders' collection
customers = list(db.customer.find({}, {'_id': 0, 'C_CUSTKEY': 1}))
orders = list(db.orders.find({'$and': [{'O_COMMENT': {'$not': {'$regex': 'pending|deposits'}}}]},
                             {'_id': 0, 'O_CUSTKEY': 1}))

# Convert orders to a dictionary where key is customer_key and value is count of orders
orders_dict = {}
for order in orders:
    key = order['O_CUSTKEY']
    if key in orders_dict:
        orders_dict[key] += 1
    else:
        orders_dict[key] = 1

# Prepare the list with customer_key and order counts
cust_order_count = [[cust['C_CUSTKEY'], orders_dict.get(cust['C_CUSTKEY'], 0)] for cust in customers]

# Create a dictionary where key is order_count and value is count of customers with that order_count
cust_dist = {}
for cust_count in cust_order_count:
    count = cust_count[1]
    if count in cust_dist:
        cust_dist[count] += 1
    else:
        cust_dist[count] = 1

# Convert cust_dist to a list of lists for the csv writer and sort it
results = [[count, cust_dist[count]] for count in cust_dist]
results.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], -x[0]))

# Write the results to the file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['C_COUNT', 'CUSTDIST']) # Column headers
    writer.writerows(results)
```

For a bash script to install Python and the necessary dependencies, you can use the following (save as `setup.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script assumes you are using a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu)

# Update system package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymongo
```

Make sure to give the bash script execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Then you can run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```
