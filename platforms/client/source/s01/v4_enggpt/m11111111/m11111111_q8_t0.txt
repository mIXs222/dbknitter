The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the year of the order and the calculated market share, specifically focusing on the nation 'INDIA.'\n\nTo achieve this, data is derived from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between parts, suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations and regions. The focus is on the 'ASIA' region and the specific part type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER.'\n\nFor each order, the volume is calculated as the extended price of line items adjusted for discounts. The volume is associated with the respective nation, considering the 'INDIA' nation. The results are then grouped by the year of the order.\n\nThe market share is computed by summing the volumes associated with 'INDIA' and dividing it by the total volume. This provides a detailed understanding of the market share dynamics for the specified part type within the 'ASIA' region, specifically highlighting the contribution of 'INDIA' over the years 1995 and 1996.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of market share trends for the 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' part in the 'ASIA' region during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the python code that will execute the described analysis on the MongoDB database. Save this code as `market_share_analysis.py`:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv
import datetime

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']

# Aggregation Pipeline for MongoDB
pipeline = [
    {'$match': {
        'P_TYPE': 'SMALL PLATED COPPER',
    }},
    {'$lookup': {
        'from': 'lineitem',
        'localField': 'P_PARTKEY',
        'foreignField': 'L_PARTKEY',
        'as': 'lineitems'
    }},
    {'$unwind': '$lineitems'},
    {'$lookup': {
        'from': 'orders',
        'localField': 'lineitems.L_ORDERKEY',
        'foreignField': 'O_ORDERKEY',
        'as': 'orders'
    }},
    {'$unwind': '$orders'},
    {'$lookup': {
        'from': 'customer',

            '$gte': datetime.datetime(1995, 1, 1),

        }
    }},
    {'$project': {
        'year': {'$year': '$orders.O_ORDERDATE'},
        'volume': {
            '$multiply': [
                '$lineitems.L_EXTENDEDPRICE',
                {'$subtract': [1, '$lineitems.L_DISCOUNT']}
            ]
        }
    }},
    {'$group': {
        '_id': {'year': '$year'},
        'total_volume': {'$sum': '$volume'},
        'total_all_volume': {'$sum': 1}
    }},
    {'$sort': {'_id.year': 1}}
]

# Execute the aggregation pipeline
result = list(db['part'].aggregate(pipeline))

# Calculate market share based on INDIA's volume divided by total volume for each year
for data in result:
    data['market_share'] = data['total_volume'] / data['total_all_volume']

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['year', 'market_share']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    for data in result:
        writer.writerow({'year': data['_id']['year'], 'market_share': data['market_share']})

print("Market share analysis completed. Results written to query_output.csv")
```

And here is the Bash script to install all the dependencies to run the python code. Save this script as `setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Make sure pip is installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo
```

Remember to give the `setup.sh` script execution permissions by running:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
``` 

You can then run `./setup.sh` to install the dependencies and `python3 market_share_analysis.py` to execute the Python script.
