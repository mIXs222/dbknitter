The analysis involves multiple nested subqueries and focuses on suppliers located in Canada ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers and nations. The main selection criteria are defined within a set of subqueries:\n\nIdentify suppliers whose supplier keys ('S_SUPPKEY') are in the set of supplier keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery filters suppliers based on parts available in specific conditions.\nThe second subquery identifies part keys ('PS_PARTKEY') from the 'partsupp' table where the associated part names ('P_NAME') start with 'forest.'\nThe third subquery calculates a threshold quantity as 50% of the sum of line item quantities for a specific part-supplier combination, meeting additional conditions like a specific ship date range ('L_SHIPDATE' between '1994-01-01' and '1995-01-01').\nThe main query filters suppliers based on the specified nation ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and addresses ('S_ADDRESS') for suppliers meeting the specified conditions, ordered in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you need to save in a file with the `.py` extension:

```python
# Dependencies: pymysql, pymongo, pandas, direct_redis
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL connection and query
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS
        FROM supplier
        WHERE S_SUPPKEY IN (
            SELECT PS_SUPPKEY
            FROM partsupp
            WHERE PS_PARTKEY IN (
                SELECT P_PARTKEY
                FROM part
                WHERE P_NAME LIKE 'forest%'
            )
        )
    """)
    suppliers = cursor.fetchall()
    df_supplier = pd.DataFrame(suppliers, columns=['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS'])
mysql_conn.close()

# Mongodb connection and query
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
canada_nation = mongodb.nation.find_one({'N_NAME': 'CANADA'}, {'N_NATIONKEY': 1})
supplier_keys = list(df_supplier['S_SUPPKEY'])
df_supplier = df_supplier[df_supplier['S_SUPPKEY'].isin(supplier_keys)]
df_supplier = df_supplier.sort_values('S_NAME')

# Redis connection and data retrieval
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

# Subquery to get the sum of line item quantities per part-supplier combination
threshold_quantities = lineitem_df.loc[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1995-01-01')
].groupby(['L_PARTKEY', 'L_SUPPKEY'])['L_QUANTITY'].sum() / 2

# Filtering the supplier DataFrame with other conditions
threshold_dict = threshold_quantities.to_dict()
df_supplier['PS_AVAILQTY_THRESHOLD'] = df_supplier.apply(lambda row: threshold_dict.get((row['PS_PARTKEY'], row['S_SUPPKEY']), 0), axis=1)
df_supplier = df_supplier[df_supplier['PS_AVAILQTY_THRESHOLD'] >= 50]

# Save the results to a CSV file
df_supplier[['S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS']].to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies, which you should save with the `.sh` extension:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Please make sure to run the `.sh` script with root privileges or use `sudo` if necessary to install packages system-wide. If you're using a virtual environment, the use of `sudo` and system-wide installation might not be necessary.
