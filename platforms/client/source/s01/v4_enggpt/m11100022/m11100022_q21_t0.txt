The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python script (`query_code.py`) to execute the given query on the original data:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import csv
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             db='tpch')

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = mongo_client["tpch"]

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query MySQL to get suppliers from Saudi Arabia
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT s.S_SUPPKEY, s.S_NAME
    FROM supplier s
    INNER JOIN nation n ON s.S_NATIONKEY = n.N_NATIONKEY
    WHERE n.N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
    """)
    suppliers_sa = cursor.fetchall()
    supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(suppliers_sa, columns=['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME'])

# Query MongoDB to get nations
nations_col = mongodb["nation"]
nations_df = pd.DataFrame(list(nations_col.find()))

# Load orders and lineitem from Redis with DirectRedis
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('orders'), orient='records')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Data processing and join operations to create the result
orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERSTATUS'] == 'F']

lineitem_with_receipt_after_commit = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE']]
lineitem_grouped = lineitem_with_receipt_after_commit.groupby('L_SUPPKEY')['L_ORDERKEY'].count().reset_index()
lineitem_grouped.columns = ['S_SUPPKEY', 'NUMWAIT']

result_df = pd.merge(supplier_df, lineitem_grouped, on='S_SUPPKEY', how='inner')
result_df = result_df.sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write the result to a CSV file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis_conn.close()
```

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python and Pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
