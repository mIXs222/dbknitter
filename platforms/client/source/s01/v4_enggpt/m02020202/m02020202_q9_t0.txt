The analysis spans multiple tables, including 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'partsupp,' 'orders,' and 'nation.'\n\nFor each relevant line item, the amount of profit is calculated, considering the extended price after discount adjustments and subtracting the supply cost multiplied by the quantity. This detailed computation is conducted for parts with names containing the term 'dim.' The results are then associated with the respective nation and year of the order.\n\nThe data is grouped by nation and year, facilitating a detailed breakdown of profit distribution over time across different nations. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the nation and in descending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of profit dynamics associated with parts containing 'dim' across various nations.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code to execute the given query with the provided details:

        database='tpch',
    )

mysql_tables = ['nation', 'part', 'partsupp', 'orders']
redis_tables = ['supplier', 'lineitem']

# Redis connection
def get_redis_connection():
    return direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from MySQL
def fetch_mysql_data(table_name, connection):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}"
    return pd.read_sql(query, connection)

# Fetch data from Redis
def fetch_redis_data(table_name, connection):
    df_json = connection.get(table_name)

def main():

    # Combine data from different databases
    # Filter parts with 'dim' in name
    dim_parts = mysql_dfs['part'][mysql_dfs['part']['P_NAME'].str.contains('dim')]

    # Order by nation asc and year desc

    # Write to CSV
    ordered_profit.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And here is the requested Bash script to install all dependencies:

`setup.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install pymysql

# Install direct_redis, assuming it exists as a pip package (this may need to be adjusted if it does not)
pip3 install direct_redis
```
Make sure to give execution permissions to the bash script by running `chmod +x setup.sh` before executing it. Additionally, you should check the existence of `direct_redis` as a pip-installable package, as this instruction may need alteration if based on specific installation procedures not covered here.
