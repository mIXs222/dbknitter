The analysis aims to summarize the number of customers, their total account balances, and the corresponding country codes.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer' and 'orders' tables. The main selection criteria are defined within a nested subquery:\n\nExtract the country codes ('CNTRYCODE') from the first two characters of customer phone numbers ('C_PHONE') using the SUBSTR function.\nInclude only customers with account balances ('C_ACCTBAL') greater than the average account balance for customers with positive balances in the specified country codes ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21').\nExclude customers who have placed orders using the NOT EXISTS condition.\nThe results, aliased as 'CUSTSALE,' are then aggregated based on country codes ('CNTRYCODE'). The summary includes the count of customers ('NUMCUST') and the sum of their account balances ('TOTACCTBAL'). The presentation orders the results in ascending order based on country codes.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code (.py):

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection_info = {
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'host': 'mysql',
    'database': 'tpch',
}
mysql_engine = create_engine(f"mysql+pymysql://{mysql_connection_info['user']}:{mysql_connection_info['password']}@{mysql_connection_info['host']}/{mysql_connection_info['database']}")

# Connect to Redis
redis_hostname = 'redis'
redis_port = 6379
redis_db = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=redis_hostname, port=redis_port, db=0)

# Query MySQL for orders not existing
query_orders = """SELECT DISTINCT O_CUSTKEY FROM orders"""
df_orders = pd.read_sql_query(query_orders, mysql_engine)

# Get customer dataframe from Redis
df_customer = redis_db.get('customer')
df_customer = pd.read_json(df_customer)

# Extract country code from phone numbers
df_customer['CNTRYCODE'] = df_customer['C_PHONE'].str[:2]

# Include customers with positive account balances greater than the average
positive_balances = df_customer[df_customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0]
average_balances = positive_balances.groupby('CNTRYCODE')['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().reset_index()
average_balances.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'AVG_ACCTBAL']

# Filter customers based on the country codes and account balances
selected_country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
filtered_customers = df_customer.merge(average_balances, on='CNTRYCODE')
filtered_customers = filtered_customers[
    (filtered_customers['C_ACCTBAL'] > filtered_customers['AVG_ACCTBAL']) &
    (filtered_customers['CNTRYCODE'].isin(selected_country_codes))
]

# Exclude customers who have placed orders
filtered_customers = filtered_customers[~filtered_customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(df_orders['O_CUSTKEY'])]

# Aggregate result
result = filtered_customers.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg({'C_CUSTKEY': 'count', 'C_ACCTBAL': 'sum'}).reset_index()
result.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'NUMCUST', 'TOTACCTBAL']

# Sort and write to csv
result.sort_values('CNTRYCODE', ascending=True).to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, for your bash script (.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a new file to store all dependencies
echo "pymysql" > requirements.txt
echo "sqlalchemy" >> requirements.txt
echo "pandas" >> requirements.txt
echo "direct_redis" >> requirements.txt

# Update system package index
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Redis server
apt-get install -y redis-server

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
