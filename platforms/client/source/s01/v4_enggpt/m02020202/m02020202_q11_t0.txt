The analysis considers the supply cost and available quantity for each part. The results aim to identify parts where the total value (calculated as the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity) exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'partsupp,' 'supplier,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, and nations. The focus is specifically on suppliers in Germany ('N_NAME' is 'GERMANY').\n\nThe results are grouped by part key, and a filtering condition ('HAVING') is applied to select only those groups where the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity surpasses a certain percentage of the overall value for Germany-based suppliers. This threshold is calculated in a subquery.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the calculated value, providing insights into the parts with the highest values that meet the specified conditions for suppliers in Germany.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code (fetch_and_combine_data.py):

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Query MySQL for nation and partsupp tables
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'GERMANY'")
    nations = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['N_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME', 'N_REGIONKEY', 'N_COMMENT'])

    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM partsupp")
    partsupps = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY', 'PS_AVAILQTY', 'PS_SUPPLYCOST', 'PS_COMMENT'])

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query Redis for supplier table
suppliers = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('supplier'), orient='records')

# Merge dataframes based on nation and supplier keys
combined_df = pd.merge(nations, suppliers, left_on='N_NATIONKEY', right_on='S_NATIONKEY')
combined_df = pd.merge(combined_df, partsupps, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='PS_SUPPKEY')

# Calculate total value
combined_df['TOTAL_VALUE'] = combined_df['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * combined_df['PS_AVAILQTY']

# Calculate threshold in subquery equivalent
threshold = combined_df['TOTAL_VALUE'].sum() * 0.05  # Example threshold: 5% of overall value

# Filter based on threshold and group by part key
result = combined_df.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').filter(lambda x: x['TOTAL_VALUE'].sum() > threshold)

# Select relevant columns
result = result[['PS_PARTKEY', 'TOTAL_VALUE']]

# Write the final output to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

2. Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and Upgrade existing packages
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install python3 -y
apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install Python library dependencies
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install direct_redis
pip3 install pandas
```

Please ensure that the bash script has execution permissions by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
