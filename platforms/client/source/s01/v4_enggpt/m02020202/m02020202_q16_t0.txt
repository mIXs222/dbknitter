Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: supplier\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- supplier: S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL, S_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct an analysis of parts and their associated suppliers, considering various criteria to filter and group the results. The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code (`query_script.py`):
```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Prepare the SQL query for MySQL part and partsupp tables
mysql_query = """
SELECT p.P_BRAND, p.P_TYPE, p.P_SIZE, COUNT(DISTINCT ps.PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT
FROM part p 
JOIN partsupp ps ON p.P_PARTKEY = ps.PS_PARTKEY

AND p.P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
AND p.P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
GROUP BY p.P_BRAND, p.P_TYPE, p.P_SIZE
"""

# Execute the query and read data into a pandas DataFrame
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    parts_and_suppliers = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'SUPPLIER_CNT'])

# Close the connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the supplier data as a pandas DataFrame
supplier_json = redis_client.get('supplier')
supplier_df = pd.read_json(supplier_json)

# Filter based on the supplier comment condition
supplier_df = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Combine the results (performing manual semi-join on P_SIZE available in both DataFrames)
final_df = parts_and_suppliers[parts_and_suppliers['P_SIZE'].isin(supplier_df['S_SUPPKEY'])]

# Order the results as specified
final_df = final_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write results to CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Bash script to install dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pandas
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# Install direct_redis (assuming this library or a similar one exists for the context)
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please modify the script and Python code according to your actual environment if your Redis database uses a non-standard library named `direct_redis`. The above assumes that `direct_redis` exists and works similarly to the standard `redis-py` client.
