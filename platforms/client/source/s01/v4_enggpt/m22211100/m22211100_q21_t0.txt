The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code and bash script as you requested:

**Python Code (`query_analysis.py`):**

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Redis connection
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)

# Load data from MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'")
    orders = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERSTATUS', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'O_CLERK', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'O_COMMENT'])

    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE L_RECEIPTDATE > L_COMMITDATE")
    lineitem = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['L_ORDERKEY', 'L_PARTKEY', 'L_SUPPKEY', 'L_LINENUMBER', 'L_QUANTITY', 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'L_DISCOUNT', 'L_TAX', 'L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS', 'L_SHIPDATE', 'L_COMMITDATE', 'L_RECEIPTDATE', 'L_SHIPINSTRUCT', 'L_SHIPMODE', 'L_COMMENT'])

mysql_conn.close()

# Load data from MongoDB
suppliers = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.supplier.find()))

# Load nation data from Redis
nation = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('nation'))

# Only consider suppliers from Saudi Arabia
nation = nation[nation['N_NAME'] == 'SAUDI ARABIA']

# Join and filter the data
results = suppliers.merge(nation, how='inner', left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Analyze only suppliers associated with 'F' orders and late receipt line items
results = results[results['S_SUPPKEY'].isin(lineitem['L_SUPPKEY']) & results['S_SUPPKEY'].isin(orders['O_ORDERKEY'])]

# Compute stats for suppliers
results['NUMWAIT'] = results['S_SUPPKEY'].apply(lambda x: lineitem[lineitem['L_SUPPKEY'] == x].shape[0])

# Sort the results
results = results[['S_NAME', 'NUMWAIT']].sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])

# Output to CSV
results.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

**Bash Script (`install_dependencies.sh`):**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install system dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas

# Additional instructions to install direct_redis package
# Add commands to install direct_redis package if it's available through pip or other means.
# For the sake of this example, assuming the direct_redis package is available via pip.

pip3 install direct_redis
```

Make sure to execute the bash script `install_dependencies.sh` before running the Python code to ensure all the dependencies are properly installed.
