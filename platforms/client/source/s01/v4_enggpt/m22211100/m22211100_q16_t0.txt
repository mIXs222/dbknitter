The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code and the corresponding Bash script to handle the described analysis:

The Python code (`analysis.py`):

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = client['tpch']
supplier_col = mongo_db['supplier']
partsupp_col = mongo_db['partsupp']

# Fetch data from MongoDB
suppliers = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier_col.find()))
partsupp = pd.DataFrame(list(partsupp_col.find()))

# Filter out suppliers with specific comments
suppliers = suppliers[~suppliers['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch part dataframe from Redis
part = redis_client.get('part')

# Merge partsupp and part on keys and apply filters
merged_df = (
    partsupp.merge(suppliers, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
    .merge(part, left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
)

# Apply filters on part attributes
filtered_df = merged_df[
    (~merged_df['P_BRAND'].eq('Brand#45')) &
    (~merged_df['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('MEDIUM POLISHED')) &
    (merged_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]))
]

# Group by brand, type, size and count distinct suppliers
grouped_df = (
    filtered_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])
    .agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=pd.NamedAgg(column='S_SUPPKEY', aggfunc="nunique"))
    .reset_index()
)

# Order the results
ordered_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write to csv
ordered_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the connections
client.close()
```

The Bash script to install the dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install pip for python package management
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install direct_redis
pip3 install pandas
```

Please make sure the script has executable permissions by running:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Run the installation script using:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

And then execute the Python code using:

```bash
python3 analysis.py
```
