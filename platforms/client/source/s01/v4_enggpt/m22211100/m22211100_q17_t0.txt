The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the required Python code to execute the query:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Query for lineitem data from MySQL
lineitem_query = """
SELECT L_PARTKEY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_QUANTITY
FROM lineitem
"""
lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(lineitem_query, mysql_conn)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get part data from Redis and convert it to a DataFrame
part_data = redis_conn.get('part')
part_df = pd.read_json(part_data)

# Filter parts with 'Brand#23' and 'MED BAG'
filtered_parts_df = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') &
                            (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Calculate the average quantity for each P_PARTKEY
avg_quantities = lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()
avg_quantities['avg_20pct'] = avg_quantities['L_QUANTITY'] * 0.20

# Merge to get average quantities for each part
lineitem_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, avg_quantities, on='L_PARTKEY')

# Filter line items where quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity
lineitem_filtered_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] < lineitem_df['avg_20pct']]

# Merge line items with the filtered parts
merge_df = pd.merge(lineitem_filtered_df, filtered_parts_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the average yearly extended price
merge_df['avg_yearly_price'] = merge_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] / 7.0

# Group by P_PARTKEY and sum the average yearly prices
result_df = merge_df.groupby('P_PARTKEY')['avg_yearly_price'].sum().reset_index()

# Write the result to a csv file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next, here is the Bash script to install the dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# Installation of direct_redis: since this may be a custom package that's not available publicly on PyPi,
# the following installation method is an example and the actual installation
# might differ based on how the direct_redis package is distributed.
pip3 install direct_redis
