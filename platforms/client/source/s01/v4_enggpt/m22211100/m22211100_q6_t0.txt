Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nCompute the total revenue generated from line items that meet specific criteria. The analysis focuses on line items with shipping dates between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994. Furthermore, the criteria include line items with a discount falling within a narrow range of 5% (0.06 - 0.01) to 7% (0.06 + 0.01) and a quantity less than 24.\n\nThe computation involves summing the extended price of line items after applying the specified discount criteria. The selected line items are those meeting the conditions of having a shipping date within the designated timeframe, a discount within the specified range, and a quantity less than 24.\n\nThis detailed analysis aims to provide a precise understanding of the revenue generated during the specified period, considering specific discount and quantity constraints on line items.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code (`query_code.py`) that you should run:

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Connect to the mysql database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch',
                             charset='utf8mb4',
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor)

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        query = """
        SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue
        FROM lineitem
        WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1994-12-31'
        AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN 0.05 AND 0.07
        AND L_QUANTITY < 24
        """
        cursor.execute(query)
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        total_revenue = result[0] if result[0] is not None else 0

    # Write the output to a csv file
    with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as output_file:
        csv_writer = csv.writer(output_file)
        csv_writer.writerow(['total_revenue'])
        csv_writer.writerow([total_revenue])
finally:
    connection.close()
```

2. Now, here is the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql
```

Run the bash script to set up your environment before executing the Python script.
