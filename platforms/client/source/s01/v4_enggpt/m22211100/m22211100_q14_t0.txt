The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that connects to MySQL and Redis, fetches the data, and performs the analysis to fulfill the query:

```python
# Python code to execute the query (query.py)
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from datetime import datetime
import direct_redis

# Function to connect to MySQL
def mysql_connection(db_name, user, password, host):
    return pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, db=db_name)

# Function to connect to Redis
def redis_connection(host, port, db_num):
    return direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=host, port=port, db=db_num)

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = mysql_connection("tpch", "root", "my-secret-pw", "mysql")

# Query to get line items with shipping date between the given range
lineitem_query = """
SELECT *
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPDATE >= %s AND L_SHIPDATE <= %s;
"""

# Run the query for line items
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(lineitem_query, ("1995-09-01", "1995-09-30"))
    lineitem_results = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert line items to DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitem_results, columns=[
    'L_ORDERKEY', 'L_PARTKEY', 'L_SUPPKEY', 'L_LINENUMBER', 'L_QUANTITY',
    'L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'L_DISCOUNT', 'L_TAX', 'L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS',
    'L_SHIPDATE', 'L_COMMITDATE', 'L_RECEIPTDATE', 'L_SHIPINSTRUCT',
    'L_SHIPMODE', 'L_COMMENT'])
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis and get part table
redis_conn = redis_connection("redis", 6379, 0)
part_df_json = redis_conn.get('part')
part_df = pd.read_json(part_df_json, orient='records')

# Ensure L_PARTKEY and P_PARTKEY are of the same type for merging
lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'] = lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].astype(int)
part_df['P_PARTKEY'] = part_df['P_PARTKEY'].astype(int)

# Merge lineitem and part tables on part key
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Filter parts with type starting with 'PROMO'
promo_parts_df = merged_df[merged_df['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('PROMO')]

# Calculate adjusted price (extended price adjusted for discount)
merged_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate promotional revenue
promo_revenue = promo_parts_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'].sum()

# Calculate total revenue
total_revenue = merged_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'].sum()

# Calculate promotional revenue percentage
promo_revenue_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue != 0 else 0

# Prepare the results DataFrame
results_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Promotional Revenue": [promo_revenue],
    "Total Revenue": [total_revenue],
    "Promotional Revenue Percentage": [promo_revenue_percentage]
})

# Write the query result to a CSV file
results_df.to_csv("query_output.csv", index=False)
```

Now, for the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# Bash script to install dependencies (install_dependencies.sh)

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Don't forget to set execution permission to the bash script before running it:

```
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
