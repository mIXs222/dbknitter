Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct a detailed analysis of line items' information based on specific criteria. The analysis focuses on line items with a shipping date on or before September 2, 1998. The results are organized and summarized based on the return flag and line status.\n\nFor each unique combination of return flag and line status, various aggregate calculations are performed:\n\nThe total quantity of items ('SUM_QTY').\nThe total base price, calculated as the sum of extended prices ('SUM_BASE_PRICE').\nThe total discounted price, considering both extended price and discount ('SUM_DISC_PRICE').\nThe total charge, factoring in tax as well ('SUM_CHARGE').\nThe average quantity per line item ('AVG_QTY').\nThe average extended price per line item ('AVG_PRICE').\nThe average discount per line item ('AVG_DISC').\nThe total count of line items ('COUNT_ORDER').\nThe results are then grouped by return flag and line status to provide insights into the distribution of these aggregates based on those attributes. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on return flag and line status, offering a detailed and organized summary of line item information meeting the specified shipping date criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
