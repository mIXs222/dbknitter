This analysis spans the time period from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1994. The calculation of revenue considers the extended price of line items, accounting for applicable discounts.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'customer,' 'orders,' 'lineitem,' 'supplier,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between customers, orders, line items, suppliers, and their respective nations and regions. Only data related to the 'ASIA' region is considered, determined by matching nation and region keys. The time frame is further constrained by including only orders placed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1994.\n\nThe results are then grouped by nation name, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation across different nations within the 'ASIA' region. The grouping is based on the total revenue for each nation, calculated by summing the extended price of line items after discount adjustments.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue, providing a detailed breakdown showcasing the nations in the 'ASIA' region, their respective total revenues, and how they contribute to the overall revenue picture during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code for your request (save it as `query_code.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL Server
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'

# Read order and lineitem tables from MySQL
mysql_query = """

    WHERE o.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1994-12-31'
"""
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    order_lineitem_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
order_lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(order_lineitem_data, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'L_DISCOUNT', 'L_ORDERKEY'])

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://root:my-secret-pw@mongodb:27017/tpch")
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
customer_col = mongodb['customer']

# Convert customers from MongoDB to pandas DataFrame
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_col.find()))

# Establish connection with Redis
import direct_redis

redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read nation and region tables from Redis

# Filtering customers by 'ASIA' region

asia_customers = customer_df[customer_df['C_NATIONKEY'].isin(asia_nation_keys)]

# Combining the data
combined_data = order_lineitem_df.merge(asia_customers, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Compute total revenue and group by nation
combined_data['REVENUE'] = combined_data['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - combined_data['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Merge with nation names
revenue_nation_names = revenue_by_nation.merge(nation_df, left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Ordering by revenue in descending order
final_result = revenue_nation_names[['N_NAME', 'REVENUE']].sort_values(by='REVENUE', ascending=False)

# Write results to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies (save it as `install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3, pip and Redis
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip redis-server

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
