The report includes the supplier and customer nations, the year of shipping, and the calculated revenue volume.\n\nTo achieve this, data is extracted from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' and 'nation' tables. The relationship between suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations is established. Specifically, the nations involved are 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA,' considering both possible pairs: ('JAPAN' as the supplier nation and 'INDIA' as the customer nation, and vice versa).\n\nThe timeframe of interest for the line items is set between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996. For each line item, the revenue volume is computed as the extended price adjusted for the discount.\n\nThe results are then grouped by supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping. This detailed grouping provides insights into how revenue is distributed over the specified period across different nation pairs and shipping years.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping, offering a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics between suppliers and customers in 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA' during the specified timeframe\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Below is a .sh file that contains a bash script to install all the dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and Python3-Pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo direct-redis
```

Save each snippet in a separate file with appropriate extensions (`.py` for the Python script and `.sh` for the bash script) and run the bash script before executing the Python code to ensure all dependencies are installed.
