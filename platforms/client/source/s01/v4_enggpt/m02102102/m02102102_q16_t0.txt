The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on your original data, combining the results from the different platforms:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM supplier")
    supplier_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert to DataFrame
supplier_columns = ['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_NATIONKEY', 'S_PHONE', 'S_ACCTBAL', 'S_COMMENT']
df_supplier = pd.DataFrame(supplier_data, columns=supplier_columns)

# Filter out suppliers with comments containing 'Customer Complaints'
df_supplier = df_supplier[~df_supplier['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
part_table = mongo_db['part']

# Get all parts and convert to DataFrame
df_part = pd.DataFrame(list(part_table.find()))

# Apply the filters to parts
df_part = df_part[
    (~df_part['P_BRAND'].str.contains('Brand#45')) &
    (~df_part['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('MEDIUM POLISHED')) &
    (df_part['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]))
]

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
partsupp_data = redis_conn.get('partsupp')

# Convert to DataFrame
df_partsupp = pd.read_json(partsupp_data.decode("utf-8"))

# Perform the join operation
result = pd.merge(df_part, df_partsupp, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')

# Group by brand, type, and size
result_grouped = result.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])

# Calculate count of distinct suppliers
result_final = result_grouped.agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=pd.NamedAgg(column='S_SUPPKEY', aggfunc='nunique')).reset_index()

# Order the results
result_final = result_final.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write results to CSV
result_final.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis_conn.close()
```

And here's a Bash script to install all dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
# install.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python pip
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo direct-redis
