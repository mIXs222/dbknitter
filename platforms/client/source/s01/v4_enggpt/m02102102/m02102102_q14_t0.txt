The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (in a file named `execute_query.py`):

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import direct_redis

# MongoDB Connection Setup
mongodb_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Redis Connection Setup
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Load 'part' table from MongoDB
part_collection = mongodb_db['part']
part_query = {'P_TYPE': {'$regex': '^PROMO'}}
parts = pd.DataFrame(list(part_collection.find(part_query)))

# Load 'lineitem' table from Redis
lineitem_key = 'lineitem'
lineitem_df = pd.read_msgpack(redis_client.get(lineitem_key))

# Convert string dates to datetime objects in 'lineitem' DataFrame
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])

# Filter the line items for the specific timeframe
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 9, 30)
filtered_lineitems = lineitem_df[(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) &
                                 (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= end_date)]

# Join the parts and line items on 'P_PARTKEY' and 'L_PARTKEY'
joined_data = filtered_lineitems.merge(parts, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the sum of extended prices for promo parts, adjusted by discounts
promo_revenue = (joined_data['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] *
                 (1 - joined_data['L_DISCOUNT'])).sum()

# Calculate the total sum of extended prices for all line items adjusted by discount
total_revenue = (filtered_lineitems['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] *
                 (1 - filtered_lineitems['L_DISCOUNT'])).sum()

# Calculate the promotional revenue percentage
promo_revenue_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Create a DataFrame to output the result
result = pd.DataFrame({
    'Promotional Revenue (%)': [promo_revenue_percentage]
})

# Write the results to 'query_output.csv'
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the MongoDB connection
mongodb_client.close()
```

Here's the Bash script (in a file named `setup.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymongo direct_redis
```

Remember to mark the bash script as executable with `chmod +x setup.sh` before running it.
