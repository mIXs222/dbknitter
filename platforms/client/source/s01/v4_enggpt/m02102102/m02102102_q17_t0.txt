Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

2. Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system's package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the pymongo and direct_redis packages using pip
pip3 install pymongo direct-redis pandas

# Install any additional missing dependencies if necessary
```

Make sure to grant execution rights to the bash script before running it using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
