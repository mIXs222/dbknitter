The main selection criteria are defined within a nested subquery:\n\nExtract the country codes ('CNTRYCODE') from the first two characters of customer phone numbers ('C_PHONE') using the SUBSTR function.\nInclude only customers with account balances ('C_ACCTBAL') greater than the average account balance for customers with positive balances in the specified country codes ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21').\nExclude customers who have placed orders using the NOT EXISTS condition.\nThe results, aliased as 'CUSTSALE,' are then aggregated based on country codes ('CNTRYCODE').

response, Here is the Python code to execute the described query using data from both MySQL and MongoDB and save the results to a `query_output.csv` file:

**Python Code (data_query.py):**
```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Query MongoDB for customer data
mongo_customers = mongodb['customer'].find({}, {'_id': 0, 'C_CUSTKEY': 1, 'C_PHONE': 1, 'C_ACCTBAL': 1})
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_customers))
customer_df['CNTRYCODE'] = customer_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2]

# Calculate average account balance for customers with positive balances in specified country codes
avg_balances = customer_df[customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0].groupby('CNTRYCODE')['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().reset_index()
avg_balances.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'AVG_ACCTBAL']
avg_balances = avg_balances[avg_balances['CNTRYCODE'].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])]

# Merge customer data with average balances for selected country codes
customer_with_avg = pd.merge(customer_df, avg_balances, on='CNTRYCODE', how='inner')

# Filter customers with account balance greater than the average in their country code
filtered_customers = customer_with_avg[customer_with_avg['C_ACCTBAL'] > customer_with_avg['AVG_ACCTBAL']]

# Get the list of customer keys who placed orders from MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT DISTINCT O_CUSTKEY FROM orders")
    order_customer_keys = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

# Exclude customers who have placed orders
final_customers = filtered_customers[~filtered_customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(order_customer_keys)]

# Aggregated results based on country codes
result = final_customers.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg(NUMCUST=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'), TOTACCTBAL=('C_ACCTBAL', 'sum')).reset_index()

# Sort results in ascending order based on country codes
result = result.sort_values(by='CNTRYCODE')

# Write results to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Clean up
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

**Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas
```

Please make sure to give execution permissions to the bash script with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` if needed and then run it before executing the Python script.
