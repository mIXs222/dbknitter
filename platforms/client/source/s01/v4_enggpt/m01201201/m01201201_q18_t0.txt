The analysis aims to identify customers, orders, and line items where the total quantity of items in an order exceeds 300 units.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve the following:\n\nSelection of orders where the order key is in the set of order keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery identifies order keys with a total quantity of items exceeding 300.\nMatching customer key in orders and line items.\nMatching order key in orders and line items.\nThe subquery calculates the total quantity of items per order key and selects only those order keys where the total quantity exceeds 300.\n\nThe main query then retrieves information such as customer name ('C_NAME'), customer key ('C_CUSTKEY'), order key ('O_ORDERKEY'), order date ('O_ORDERDATE'), total price of the order ('O_TOTALPRICE'), and the sum of quantities of items in the line items associated with each order.\n\nThe results are grouped by customer name, customer key, order key, order date, and total price. The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the total price of the order and then by order date. This ordering provides a detailed view of customer orders meeting the specified quantity criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code:

```python
# Import required libraries
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB database
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis database
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query the 'orders' table in MySQL to get orders with total item quantity > 300
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    subquery = """
    SELECT O_ORDERKEY
    FROM lineitem
    INNER JOIN orders ON O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
    GROUP BY O_ORDERKEY
    HAVING SUM(L_QUANTITY) > 300
    """
    cursor.execute(subquery)
    order_keys = [item[0] for item in cursor.fetchall()]

# Query the 'lineitem' collection in MongoDB and filter by the order keys
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.lineitem.find({'L_ORDERKEY': {'$in': order_keys}})))

# Query 'orders' table in MySQL and join with the results from 'lineitem' collection
orders_query = f"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERKEY IN ({','.join(map(str, order_keys))})"
orders_df = pd.read_sql(orders_query, mysql_conn)

# Join 'orders' and 'lineitem' dataframes
joined_df = orders_df.merge(lineitem_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Get 'customer' data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('customer'))

# Join 'customer' dataframe with 'joined' dataframe
final_df = joined_df.merge(customer_df, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Calculate the sum of quantities in line items and group by relevant fields
final_df['TOTAL_QUANTITY'] = final_df.groupby(['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE'])['L_QUANTITY'].transform('sum')

# Filter grouped dataframe based on total quantity criterion and order by total price and order date
result_df = final_df[final_df['TOTAL_QUANTITY'] > 300].groupby(['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE']).first().reset_index()

# Sort the results and select relevant columns
output_df = result_df.sort_values(by=['O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])
output_df = output_df[['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'TOTAL_QUANTITY']]

# Write the query output to a CSV file
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the database connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install python, pip, redis, mysql and mongodb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas sqlalchemy direct_redis
```

Save the Python code in a file named `execute_query.py` and the Bash script in a file named `install_dependencies.sh`. Remember to give execution permission to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
