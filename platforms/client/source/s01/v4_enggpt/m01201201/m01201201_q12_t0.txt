The analysis distinguishes between high-priority ('1-URGENT' and '2-HIGH') and low-priority orders. The results aim to provide a count of line items for each shipping mode falling into these priority categories.\n\nData is sourced from the 'orders' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing a relationship between orders and their corresponding line items. The criteria for selection include matching order and line item keys, specific shipping modes ('MAIL' and 'SHIP'), and ensuring that the commitment date is earlier than the receipt date, the shipping date is earlier than the commitment date, and the receipt date falls between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994.\n\nTwo counts are calculated for each shipping mode:\n\n'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\n'LOW_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders not marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\nThe results are then grouped by shipping mode, offering insights into the distribution of line items based on shipping modes and order priorities. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the shipping mode, providing a comprehensive view of line item counts categorized by shipping mode and order priority.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`execute_query.py`) to execute the given query on the original data from different platforms:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongodb_db['lineitem']

# Fetch high and low priority orders from MySQL
high_priority_orders = []
low_priority_orders = []
try:
    mysql_cursor.execute(
        "SELECT O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERPRIORITY FROM orders "
        "WHERE O_ORDERPRIORITY IN ('1-URGENT', '2-HIGH')"
    )
    high_priority_orders = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
    
    mysql_cursor.execute(
        "SELECT O_ORDERKEY FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERPRIORITY NOT IN ('1-URGENT', '2-HIGH')"
    )
    low_priority_orders = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
finally:
    mysql_cursor.close()
    mysql_conn.close()

high_priority_orders_keys = {row[0] for row in high_priority_orders}
low_priority_orders_keys = {row[0] for row in low_priority_orders}

# Convert string dates to datetime objects for comparison
start_date = datetime.strptime('1994-01-01', '%Y-%m-%d')
end_date = datetime.strptime('1994-12-31', '%Y-%m-%d')

# Process the lineitems in MongoDB
results = {'MAIL': {'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': 0, 'LOW_LINE_COUNT': 0},
           'SHIP': {'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': 0, 'LOW_LINE_COUNT': 0}}

        lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'] < lineitem['L_COMMITDATE'] and
        start_date <= lineitem['L_RECEIPTDATE'] <= end_date):

        if lineitem['L_ORDERKEY'] in high_priority_orders_keys:
            results[lineitem['L_SHIPMODE']]['HIGH_LINE_COUNT'] += 1
        elif lineitem['L_ORDERKEY'] in low_priority_orders_keys:
            results[lineitem['L_SHIPMODE']]['LOW_LINE_COUNT'] += 1

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['SHIPPING_MODE', 'HIGH_LINE_COUNT', 'LOW_LINE_COUNT'])

    for mode in sorted(results.keys()):
        writer.writerow([mode, results[mode]['HIGH_LINE_COUNT'], results[mode]['LOW_LINE_COUNT']])
```

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all the dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL and PyMongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Don't forget to make the bash script executable by running the following command:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
