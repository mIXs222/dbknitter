The main selection criteria are defined within a nested subquery:\n\nExtract the country codes ('CNTRYCODE') from the first two characters of customer phone numbers ('C_PHONE') using the SUBSTR function.\nInclude only customers with account balances ('C_ACCTBAL') greater than the average account balance for customers with positive balances in the specified country codes ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21').\nExclude customers who have placed orders using the NOT EXISTS condition.\nThe results, aliased as 'CUSTSALE,' are then aggregated based on country codes ('CNTRYCODE'). The summary includes the count of customers ('NUMCUST') and the sum of their account balances ('TOTACCTBAL'). The presentation orders the results in ascending order based on country codes.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (.py) required to execute the query on your original data:

```python

    """
    customer_positive_balance_df = pd.read_sql(positive_balance_cust_query, mysql_conn)

    # Calculate the average account balance for customers in specific country codes
    customer_positive_balance_df['CNTRYCODE'] = customer_positive_balance_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2]
    avg_acct_bal_df = customer_positive_balance_df[customer_positive_balance_df['CNTRYCODE'].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])].groupby('CNTRYCODE')['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().reset_index()
