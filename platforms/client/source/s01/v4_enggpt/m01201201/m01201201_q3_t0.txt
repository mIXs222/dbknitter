The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the python code to execute this query:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Establish a connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Establish a connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Establish a connection to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Load the orders data from MySQL
query_orders = """
SELECT O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_SHIPPRIORITY
FROM orders
WHERE O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15';
"""
orders_df = pd.read_sql(query_orders, mysql_conn)

# Load the lineitem data from MongoDB
lineitem_query = {
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gt': '1995-03-15'}
}
lineitem_projection = {
    '_id': False,
}
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.lineitem.find(lineitem_query, projection=lineitem_projection)))

# Load the customer data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('customer'), orient='records')

# Merge the dataframes
merged_df = (
    customer_df[customer_df['C_MKTSEGMENT'] == 'BUILDING']
    .merge(orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
    .merge(lineitem_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')
)

# Calculate the revenue
merged_df['revenue'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group the merged dataframe
grouped_df = (
    merged_df
    .groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])
    .agg({'revenue': 'sum'})
    .reset_index()
)

# Sort the grouped dataframe
result_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['revenue', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write the result to a CSV file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis_conn.close()
```

And here's the bash script for installing all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update repositories and install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install the Python libraries for MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis data access
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
