The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the described query, which requires fetching data from both MySQL and MongoDB, processing, and combining them:

```python
import csv
import pymysql
import pymongo
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
lineitems = mongodb['lineitem']

def get_suppliers_from_nation(nation_name, mysql_conn):
    cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(
        "SELECT S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME FROM supplier "
        "JOIN nation ON supplier.S_NATIONKEY = nation.N_NATIONKEY "
        "WHERE nation.N_NAME = %s", (nation_name,)
    )
    suppliers = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    return {suppkey: name for suppkey, name in suppliers}

def get_fulfilled_orders(mysql_conn):
    cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT O_ORDERKEY FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'")
    orders = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    return {row[0] for row in orders}

def get_lineitem_data(supplier_keys, fulfilled_orders, lineitems):
    waiting_times = {suppkey: 0 for suppkey in supplier_keys}
    for lineitem in lineitems.find({"L_SUPPKEY": {"$in": list(supplier_keys)}}):
        if (lineitem["L_ORDERKEY"] in fulfilled_orders and
                lineitem["L_RECEIPTDATE"] > lineitem["L_COMMITDATE"]):
            waiting_times[lineitem["L_SUPPKEY"]] += 1
    return waiting_times

# Get suppliers from Saudi Arabia
saudi_suppliers = get_suppliers_from_nation("SAUDI ARABIA", mysql_conn)

# Get fulfilled orders
fulfilled_orders = get_fulfilled_orders(mysql_conn)

# Get line items data
waiting_times = get_lineitem_data(set(saudi_suppliers.keys()), fulfilled_orders, lineitems)

# Combine data and sort by waiting time descending and supplier name ascending
combined_data = [(saudi_suppliers[suppkey], waiting_times[suppkey]) for suppkey in waiting_times]
combined_data.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))

# Write output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['S_NAME', 'NUMWAIT'])
    csvwriter.writerows(combined_data)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
client.close()
```

Now, here is the bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python pip if it's not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
