The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the shipping date falls between September 1, 1995, and September 30, 1995. The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query_exec.py`) that performs the required analysis:

```python
# query_exec.py
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
import redis
from datetime import datetime
import csv

# Create a MongoDB connection
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongo_db['lineitem']

# Get lineitem data from MongoDB
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 9, 30)
lineitem_query = {
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lte': end_date}
}
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find(lineitem_query, projection={'_id': False})))

# Create a Redis connection
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)

# Get part data from Redis
part_keys = redis_client.keys('part:*')
part_data = pd.DataFrame([eval(redis_client.get(key)) for key in part_keys])

# Filtering line items with the corresponding parts
lineitem_data['L_PARTKEY'] = lineitem_data['L_PARTKEY'].astype(int) # Ensure correct data type
combined_data = lineitem_data.merge(part_data, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Promotional & Total Revenue Calculation
combined_data['ADJUSTED_PRICE'] = combined_data['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - combined_data['L_DISCOUNT'])
promo_revenue = combined_data[combined_data['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('PROMO')]['ADJUSTED_PRICE'].sum()
total_revenue = combined_data['ADJUSTED_PRICE'].sum()
promo_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Writing output to a file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Promotional Revenue', 'Total Revenue', 'Promotional Revenue Percentage'])
    writer.writerow([promo_revenue, total_revenue, promo_percentage])

print('The query has been executed and the results are saved in "query_output.csv".')
```

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Make the script fail if any command in it fails
set -e

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and Pip if they're not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymongo redis
