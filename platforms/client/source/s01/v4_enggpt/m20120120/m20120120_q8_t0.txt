The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the year of the order and the calculated market share, specifically focusing on the nation 'INDIA.'\n\nTo achieve this, data is derived from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between parts, suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations and regions. The focus is on the 'ASIA' region and the specific part type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER.'\n\nFor each order, the volume is calculated as the extended price of line items adjusted for discounts. The volume is associated with the respective nation, considering the 'INDIA' nation. The results are then grouped by the year of the order.\n\nThe market share is computed by summing the volumes associated with 'INDIA' and dividing it by the total volume. This provides a detailed understanding of the market share dynamics for the specified part type within the 'ASIA' region, specifically highlighting the contribution of 'INDIA' over the years 1995 and 1996.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of market share trends for the 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' part in the 'ASIA' region during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code (query.py):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Query MySQL for region and lineitem data
query_region = """
SELECT R_REGIONKEY FROM region WHERE R_NAME = 'ASIA'
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(query_region)
regions_asia_keys = [record[0] for record in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]

query_lineitem = """
SELECT L_ORDERKEY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_SHIPDATE 
FROM lineitem
WHERE YEAR(L_SHIPDATE) BETWEEN 1995 AND 1996
"""
lineitems_df = pd.read_sql(query_lineitem, mysql_conn)

# Clean up MySQL connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Query MongoDB for part and customer data
parts = mongo_db['part']
parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(parts.find({'P_TYPE': 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'})))

customers = mongo_db['customer']
customers_df = pd.DataFrame(list(customers.find()))

mongo_client.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query Redis for nation, supplier and orders data
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('nation'))
supplier_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('supplier'))
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('orders'))

# Analysis
# Join dataframes based on their relationships
suppliers_india = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'] == nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'INDIA']['N_NATIONKEY'].iloc[0]]
orders_india = orders_df[orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'].isin(customers_df[customers_df['C_NATIONKEY'].isin(nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'INDIA']['N_NATIONKEY'])]['C_CUSTKEY'])]
lineitems_india = lineitems_df[lineitems_df['L_ORDERKEY'].isin(orders_india['O_ORDERKEY'])]
market_df = lineitems_india.merge(parts_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate volume
market_df['VOLUME'] = market_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - market_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate market share
total_volume = market_df.groupby(market_df['L_SHIPDATE'].dt.year)['VOLUME'].sum()
india_volume = market_df[market_df['O_ORDERKEY'].isin(orders_india['O_ORDERKEY'])].groupby(market_df['L_SHIPDATE'].dt.year)['VOLUME'].sum()
market_share = india_volume / total_volume

# Formatted result
market_share_result = market_share.reset_index()
market_share_result.columns = ['YEAR', 'MARKET_SHARE']
market_share_result.sort_values('YEAR', inplace=True)

# Write output to CSV
market_share_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies for running the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if needed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql

# Install PyMongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install direct_redis
```

To use this bash script, you would likely need to give it executable permissions and then execute it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Then you can run the Python script:

```bash
python3 query.py
```
