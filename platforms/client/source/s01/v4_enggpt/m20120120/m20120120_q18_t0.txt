The analysis aims to identify customers, orders, and line items where the total quantity of items in an order exceeds 300 units.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve the following:\n\nSelection of orders where the order key is in the set of order keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery identifies order keys with a total quantity of items exceeding 300.\nMatching customer key in orders and line items.\nMatching order key in orders and line items.\nThe subquery calculates the total quantity of items per order key and selects only those order keys where the total quantity exceeds 300.\n\nThe main query then retrieves information such as customer name ('C_NAME'), customer key ('C_CUSTKEY'), order key ('O_ORDERKEY'), order date ('O_ORDERDATE'), total price of the order ('O_TOTALPRICE'), and the sum of quantities of items in the line items associated with each order.\n\nThe results are grouped by customer name, customer key, order key, order date, and total price. The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the total price of the order and then by order date. This ordering provides a detailed view of customer orders meeting the specified quantity criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (.py) to execute the query to get the data from different databases and combine the results. This code will write the output to the file `query_output.csv`.

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    # Subquery to get Order Keys with total quantity over 300
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT L_ORDERKEY, SUM(L_QUANTITY) as total_quantity
        FROM lineitem
        GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY
        HAVING SUM(L_QUANTITY) > 300;
    """)
    qualifying_orders = cursor.fetchall()
    qualifying_order_keys = [order[0] for order in qualifying_orders]

# Convert list to tuple for SQL use
qualifying_order_keys_tuple = tuple(qualifying_order_keys)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_cursor = mongo_db['customer'].find({}, {"_id": 0})

# Convert MongoDB data to pandas DataFrame
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_cursor))

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders_df_str = redis_client.get('orders')
orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_df_str)

# Filter the orders DataFrame with qualifying order keys
filtered_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERKEY'].isin(qualifying_order_keys)]

# Merge customer and orders DataFrame on 'C_CUSTKEY'
merged_df = pd.merge(customer_df, filtered_orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')

# Load lineitem data from MySQL
df_lineitem = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE L_ORDERKEY IN {}".format(qualifying_order_keys_tuple), con=mysql_conn)

# Calculate the sum of quantity group by L_ORDERKEY in lineitem DataFrame
lineitem_grouped = df_lineitem.groupby('L_ORDERKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].sum().reset_index()

# Merge results with the final DataFrame
final_df = pd.merge(merged_df, lineitem_grouped, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Additional merge to get order details (since lineitem data doesn't have price)
orders_details = filtered_orders_df[['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE']]
final_df = pd.merge(final_df, orders_details, on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Select relevant fields and set alias
output_df = final_df[['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'L_QUANTITY']]

# Sort the results
output_df = output_df.sort_values(by=['O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write to CSV
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis_client.close()
```

And here's the bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install Python pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis sqlalchemy
