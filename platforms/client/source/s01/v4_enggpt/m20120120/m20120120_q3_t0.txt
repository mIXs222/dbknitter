The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code (`query_analysis.py`) to execute the distributed query:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
from datetime import datetime

# MySQL connection - retrieve lineitem data
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             db='tpch')

# Retrieve lineitem data within the specified date range and apply discount
query_lineitem = """
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as revenue
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY;
"""

lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(query_lineitem, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# MongoDB connection - retrieve customer data with market segment 'BUILDING'
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
customer_col = mongo_db["customer"]

# Using aggregation to filter 'BUILDING' customers and their orders
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"C_MKTSEGMENT": "BUILDING"}},
    {"$project": {"C_CUSTKEY": 1}}
]

cust_df = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_col.aggregate(pipeline)))
mongo_client.close()

# Redis connection - retrieve orders data with desired order date
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(port=6379, host='redis')

orders = redis_conn.get("orders")
orders_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(orders)

# Filter orders with order date before '1995-03-15'
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
filtered_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] < datetime(1995, 3, 15)]

# Merging the data frames for final output
merged_df = (
    filtered_orders_df
    .merge(cust_df, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
    .merge(lineitem_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')
)

# Grouping by order key, order date, and shipping priority
grouped_df = merged_df.groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])

# Summing up revenue for each group
final_df = grouped_df['revenue'].sum().reset_index()

# Sorting by revenue in descending order and order date in ascending order
final_df.sort_values(by=['revenue', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True], inplace=True)

# Output to CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. And here is the Bash script (`setup.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip if it's not already installed
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct_redis
