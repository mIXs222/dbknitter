The analysis distinguishes between high-priority ('1-URGENT' and '2-HIGH') and low-priority orders. The results aim to provide a count of line items for each shipping mode falling into these priority categories.\n\nData is sourced from the 'orders' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing a relationship between orders and their corresponding line items. The criteria for selection include matching order and line item keys, specific shipping modes ('MAIL' and 'SHIP'), and ensuring that the commitment date is earlier than the receipt date, the shipping date is earlier than the commitment date, and the receipt date falls between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994.\n\nTwo counts are calculated for each shipping mode:\n\n'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\n'LOW_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders not marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\nThe results are then grouped by shipping mode, offering insights into the distribution of line items based on shipping modes and order priorities. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the shipping mode, providing a comprehensive view of line item counts categorized by shipping mode and order priority.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that performs the described analysis:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Query to get the lineitem data from mysql
lineitem_query = """
SELECT L_ORDERKEY, L_SHIPMODE
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')
  AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE
  AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE
  AND L_RECEIPTDATE BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1994-12-31'
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(lineitem_query)
lineitem_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Dataframe for lineitem data
df_lineitem = pd.DataFrame(lineitem_data, columns=['L_ORDERKEY', 'L_SHIPMODE'])
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the orders data from redis
orders_data = redis_conn.get('orders')
df_orders = pd.read_csv(pd.compat.StringIO(orders_data.decode('utf-8')))

# Merge dataframes on order key
df_merged = pd.merge(df_lineitem, df_orders, how='inner', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Filter high-priority and low-priority orders
df_high_priority = df_merged[df_merged['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].isin(['1-URGENT', '2-HIGH'])]
df_low_priority = df_merged[~df_merged['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].isin(['1-URGENT', '2-HIGH'])]

# Group and count line items by shipping mode for high-priority
df_high_priority_count = df_high_priority.groupby('L_SHIPMODE').size().reset_index(name='HIGH_LINE_COUNT')

# Group and count line items by shipping mode for low-priority
df_low_priority_count = df_low_priority.groupby('L_SHIPMODE').size().reset_index(name='LOW_LINE_COUNT')

# Merge the counts
df_counts = pd.merge(df_high_priority_count, df_low_priority_count, on='L_SHIPMODE', how='outer')

# Sorting the results by shipping mode
df_counts.sort_values('L_SHIPMODE', inplace=True)

# Output to CSV file
df_counts.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies for the Python code provided:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package information
sudo apt update

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis
```

Please note that the above code assumes that the Redis server is configured to use `DirectRedis` and that the 'orders' data is stored as a CSV string accessible through the key 'orders'. The script assumes an environment that uses `apt` and `pip3`, typically found in Debian-based Linux distributions.
