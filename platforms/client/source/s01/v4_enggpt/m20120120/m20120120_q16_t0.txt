The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the requested Python code that executes the query:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             db='tpch')
# Execute query for partsupp from MySQL
partsupp_query = """
SELECT PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY
FROM partsupp
"""
partsupp_df = pd.read_sql(partsupp_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
part_collection = mongo_db['part']
# Query for part from MongoDB
part_query = {
    'P_PARTKEY': {'$in': list(partsupp_df['PS_PARTKEY'])},
    'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'},
    'P_TYPE': {'$not': {'$regex': '^MEDIUM POLISHED'}},
    'P_SIZE': {'$in': [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]}
}
part_cursor = part_collection.find(part_query, {'_id': 0})
part_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part_cursor))
mongo_client.close()

# Combine and process partsupp and part dataframes
combined_df = partsupp_df.merge(part_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
# Filter out suppliers with comments containing 'Customer Complaints'
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame()
for key in redis_conn.get('supplier'):
    supplier_info = pd.read_json(key)
    if 'Customer Complaints' not in supplier_info['S_COMMENT']:
        supplier_df = supplier_df.append(supplier_info, ignore_index=True)
redis_conn.connection_pool.disconnect()

# Merge combined_df with supplier_df using PS_SUPPKEY and S_SUPPKEY
results_df = combined_df.merge(supplier_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Group by brand, type, and size and count distinct suppliers
grouped_df = results_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=('PS_SUPPKEY', 'nunique')).reset_index()

# Sort the results according to the specified condition
sorted_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write the final result to query_output.csv
sorted_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the corresponding Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories and install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Please note that you will need execution permissions to run the Bash script. You can grant execution permissions using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Then you can execute the script:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Run the Python script afterward to perform the query:

```bash
python3 query.py
```
