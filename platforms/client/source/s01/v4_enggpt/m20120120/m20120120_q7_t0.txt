The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the supplier and customer nations, the year of shipping, and the calculated revenue volume.\n\nTo achieve this, data is extracted from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' and 'nation' tables. The relationship between suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations is established. Specifically, the nations involved are 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA,' considering both possible pairs: ('JAPAN' as the supplier nation and 'INDIA' as the customer nation, and vice versa).\n\nThe timeframe of interest for the line items is set between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996. For each line item, the revenue volume is computed as the extended price adjusted for the discount.\n\nThe results are then grouped by supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping. This detailed grouping provides insights into how revenue is distributed over the specified period across different nation pairs and shipping years.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping, offering a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics between suppliers and customers in 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA' during the specified timeframe\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code (`query_code.py`) designed to achieve the requested task:

```python

mysql_db = pymysql.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch', host='mysql')

mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
customer_collection = mongodb['customer']

# Redis connection
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query MySQL for lineitem and nation tables
query_lineitem = """

"""
cursor.execute(query_lineitem)
lineitems = cursor.fetchall()

# Load data into pandas dataframe
lineitems_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitems, columns=['L_ORDERKEY', 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'L_DISCOUNT', 'L_SHIPDATE', 'SUPPLIER_NATION', 'O_CUSTKEY'])

# Get customer table from MongoDB
customers_df = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0, 'C_CUSTKEY': 1, 'C_NATIONKEY': 1})))

# Get nation table from Redis
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('nation'), orient='records')

# Merge dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitems_df, customers_df, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY', how='inner')

# Calculate revenue
filtered_df['REVENUE'] = filtered_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Extract year from SHIPDATE
filtered_df['YEAR'] = pd.to_datetime(filtered_df['L_SHIPDATE']).dt.year

# Group by necessary fields
grouped_df = filtered_df.groupby(['N_NAME', 'YEAR']).agg({'REVENUE': 'sum'}).reset_index()

# Sort by specified columns
grouped_df.sort_values(['N_NAME', 'YEAR'], ascending=[True, True], inplace=True)

# Write output to CSV
grouped_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the database connections
cursor.close()
mysql_db.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis.close()
```

2. Here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Update package lists
apt-get update -y

# Install Python and Pip if they are not available
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo redis direct-redis

# Note that direct-redis may need to be installed according to its availability or provided by the user.
