The main selection criteria are defined within a nested subquery:\n\nExtract the country codes ('CNTRYCODE') from the first two characters of customer phone numbers ('C_PHONE') using the SUBSTR function.\nInclude only customers with account balances ('C_ACCTBAL') greater than the average account balance for customers with positive balances in the specified country codes ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21').\nExclude customers who have placed orders using the NOT EXISTS condition.\nThe results, aliased as 'CUSTSALE,' are then aggregated based on country codes ('CNTRYCODE'). The summary includes the count of customers ('NUMCUST') and the sum of their account balances ('TOTACCTBAL'). The presentation orders the results in ascending order based on country codes.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code:

```python
# query.py

import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import redis
from io import StringIO

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
customer_coll = mongodb['customer']

# Connect to Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)

# Fetch customer data from MongoDB
customers = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_coll.find()))

# Extract country codes from phone numbers and add as a new column
customers['CNTRYCODE'] = customers['C_PHONE'].str[:2]

# Calculate average account balance for specified country codes
codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
avg_balances = customers[
    (customers['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0) & (customers['CNTRYCODE'].isin(codes))
].groupby('CNTRYCODE')['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().to_dict()

# Apply filter for customers with account balance greater than the average
customers = customers[
    customers.apply(lambda x: x['C_ACCTBAL'] > avg_balances.get(x['CNTRYCODE'], 0), axis=1)
]

# Fetch orders data from Redis and convert to DataFrame
orders = pd.read_json(StringIO(r.get('orders')), orient='records')

# Identify customers who have not placed any orders
customers_with_no_orders = customers[
    ~customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(orders['O_CUSTKEY'])
]

# Aggregate the results
result = customers_with_no_orders.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg(
    NUMCUST=pd.NamedAgg(column='C_CUSTKEY', aggfunc='count'),
    TOTACCTBAL=pd.NamedAgg(column='C_ACCTBAL', aggfunc='sum'),
)

# Order the results
result = result.sort_values(by='CNTRYCODE').reset_index()

# Write the results to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script for installing all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis
```

Save these scripts as `query.py` and `install_dependencies.sh`, respectively, and run the bash script to install the dependencies before executing the python code.
