The analysis focuses on line items, where the shipping date falls within this specified timeframe. The results aim to identify the supplier with the maximum total revenue during this period.\n\nIn the first part of the query, a Common Table Expression (CTE) named 'revenue0' is created. This CTE calculates the total revenue for each supplier ('SUPPLIER_NO') based on the sum of extended prices adjusted for discounts from relevant line items. The calculation is performed for line items with shipping dates between January 1, 1996, and March 31, 1996. The results are grouped by supplier.\n\nIn the second part of the query, the main selection is made from the 'supplier' table, along with the 'revenue0' CTE. The results include supplier information such as supplier key ('S_SUPPKEY'), name ('S_NAME'), address ('S_ADDRESS'), and phone number ('S_PHONE'), along with the total revenue calculated in the CTE. The selection is filtered to include only the supplier with the maximum total revenue during the specified timeframe.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the supplier key ('S_SUPPKEY'). This ordering provides a comprehensive view of supplier details for the supplier with the highest total revenue during the specified three-month period.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the desired query using `pymysql` for MySQL and `direct_redis` for Redis. The code will save the output to `query_output.csv`.

**Python Code (query.py):**
```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connection information
mysql_config = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch'
}

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host=mysql_config['host'],
    user=mysql_config['user'],
    password=mysql_config['password'],
    db=mysql_config['db']
)

# Prepare the query for "lineitem" on MySQL
lineitem_query = """
SELECT
    L_SUPPKEY as SUPPLIER_NO,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1996-01-01' AND '1996-03-31'
GROUP BY
    L_SUPPKEY
"""

# Execute query on MySQL
lineitem_data = pd.read_sql(lineitem_query, con=mysql_conn)
lineitem_data['TOTAL_REVENUE'] = lineitem_data['TOTAL_REVENUE'].astype('float')
# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(
    host='redis',
    port=6379,
    db=0
)

# Fetch the "supplier" table from Redis
supplier_data_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('supplier'), orient='records')

# Merge dataframes based on SUPPLIER_NO and S_SUPPKEY
merged_data = pd.merge(supplier_data_df, lineitem_data, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='SUPPLIER_NO', how='inner')

# Identify the supplier with maximum total revenue
max_revenue_supplier = merged_data.loc[merged_data['TOTAL_REVENUE'].idxmax()]

# Format the output dataframe
output_df = max_revenue_supplier[['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE', 'TOTAL_REVENUE']].to_frame().transpose().sort_values('S_SUPPKEY')

# Write the final output to CSV
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

**Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install MySQL and Redis client
pip install pymysql
pip install direct-redis
pip install pandas
