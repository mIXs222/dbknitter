The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to execute the required operation:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB database
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
part_col = mongo_db['part']

# Find parts with the specific brand and container type from MongoDB
part_filter = {'P_BRAND': 'Brand#23', 'P_CONTAINER': 'MED BAG'}
parts = part_col.find(part_filter, {'P_PARTKEY': 1})

# Get all relevant part keys
part_keys = [p['P_PARTKEY'] for p in parts]

# Construct the custom query to be executed on the MySQL database
sql_query = """
    SELECT L_ORDERKEY, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY_EXTENDED_PRICE
    FROM lineitem 
    WHERE L_PARTKEY IN (%s) 
    AND L_QUANTITY < (
        SELECT 0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY) FROM lineitem WHERE L_PARTKEY = lineitem.L_PARTKEY
    )
    GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY;
""" % ','.join(map(str, part_keys))

# Execute the MySQL query
mysql_cursor.execute(sql_query)

# Fetch all the results
results = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Write results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    # Write the header
    csvwriter.writerow(['L_ORDERKEY', 'AVG_YEARLY_EXTENDEDPRICE'])
    # Write the data
    csvwriter.writerows(results)

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and Pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python modules
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
