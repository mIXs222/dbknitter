The main selection criteria are defined within a set of subqueries:\n\nIdentify suppliers whose supplier keys ('S_SUPPKEY') are in the set of supplier keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery filters suppliers based on parts available in specific conditions.\nThe second subquery identifies part keys ('PS_PARTKEY') from the 'partsupp' table where the associated part names ('P_NAME') start with 'forest.'\nThe third subquery calculates a threshold quantity as 50% of the sum of line item quantities for a specific part-supplier combination, meeting additional conditions like a specific ship date range ('L_SHIPDATE' between '1994-01-01' and '1995-01-01').\nThe main query filters suppliers based on the specified nation ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and addresses ('S_ADDRESS') for suppliers meeting the specified conditions, ordered in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`query.py`):

```python

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')

# Connect to MongoDB

            FROM nation 
            WHERE N_NAME = 'CANADA' 
        )
    """)
    suppliers_in_canada = cursor.fetchall()

# Query Redis for the nation table
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('nation'))

# Filter nation_df for Canada
canadian_nationkeys = nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'CANADA']['N_NATIONKEY'].tolist()

# Filter suppliers_in_canada for those in canadian_nationkeys
suppliers_in_canada_df = pd.DataFrame(suppliers_in_canada, columns=['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS'])
suppliers_in_canada_df = suppliers_in_canada_df[suppliers_in_canada_df['S_SUPPKEY'].isin(canadian_nationkeys)]

# Query MongoDB for line items

    "L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte": ObjectId.from_datetime(pd.Timestamp('1994-01-01').to_pydatetime()),
                   "$lt": ObjectId.from_datetime(pd.Timestamp('1995-01-01').to_pydatetime())}

        'SUM_QUANTITY': {'$sum': '$L_QUANTITY'}
    }}
])

# Filter for threshold quantity
threshold_quantities = {item['_id']: item['SUM_QUANTITY'] for item in lineitem_quantities if item['SUM_QUANTITY'] >= 50}

# Query MySQL for partsupp with parts starting with 'forest'
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT PS_SUPPKEY, PS_PARTKEY, PS_AVAILQTY
        FROM partsupp
        WHERE PS_PARTKEY IN ( 
            SELECT P_PARTKEY 
            FROM part 
            WHERE P_NAME LIKE 'forest%'
        )
    """)
    partsupp_records = cursor.fetchall()

# Filter partsupp for threshold quantities
threshold_partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(partsupp_records, columns=['PS_SUPPKEY', 'PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_AVAILQTY'])
threshold_partsupp_df = threshold_partsupp_df[
    threshold_partsupp_df.apply(lambda row: (row['PS_PARTKEY'], row['PS_SUPPKEY']) in threshold_quantities, axis=1)
]

# Final join to get supplier names and addresses
final_suppliers_df = suppliers_in_canada_df.merge(threshold_partsupp_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='PS_SUPPKEY', how='inner')

# Write the results to a CSV file
final_suppliers_df[['S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS']].sort_values('S_NAME').to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)

# Close connections
mysql_connection.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis_client.close()
```

And here's the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install system dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev build-essential

# Upgrade pip and install Python dependencies
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Make sure to set the executable permission for the bash script after creating it by running:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Please note that the actual implementation and functionality of `direct_redis.DirectRedis` are not specified as it's not a standard Python package for interacting with Redis. Assuming it works like the standard `redis.Redis` client and returns a Pandas DataFrame when calling `get('tablename')`, the code should function correctly. If the actual implementation differs, the code related to Redis would need to be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, the ObjectId conversion from datetime for MongoDB may require adaptation depending on the specific details of the database setup.
