The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

    # and beyond the scope of a single script, you may need additional functions
    # or pre-processing steps to align data models and perform analysis.

For the Bash script to install dependencies (.sh):

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update packages and upgrade the system
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install pip for Python package management
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MySQL client
sudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-client

# Install Redis tools
sudo apt-get install -y redis-tools

# Make sure to install pandas, pymysql, pymongo and direct_redis Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo direct_redis

# Note: The user should be aware that they need MongoDB and Redis servers running and accessible
