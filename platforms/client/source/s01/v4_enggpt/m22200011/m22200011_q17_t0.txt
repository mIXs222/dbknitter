Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below are the two files as requested:

1. The Python code (query_code.py):
```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from bson.json_util import dumps
import direct_redis
import json

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_collection = mongo_db['lineitem']

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read 'part' table from Redis and convert to pandas DataFrame
part_data = json.loads(redis_conn.get('part'))
part_df = pd.DataFrame(part_data)

# Filter 'part' DataFrame for 'Brand#23' and 'MED BAG'
filtered_parts = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Retrieve 'lineitem' table in MongoDB in its entirety
lineitem_data = mongo_collection.find({}, {'_id': False})
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_data))

# Image we have part and lineitem data loaded appropriately
# Create a DataFrame for average quantities
average_quantity_df = lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()
average_quantity_df.columns = ['L_PARTKEY', 'AVG_QUANTITY']

# Merge filtered_parts with average_quantity_df to get average quantity
filtered_parts = filtered_parts.merge(average_quantity_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')

# Keep only parts whose line item quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df.merge(filtered_parts, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
filtered_lineitem_df = filtered_lineitem_df[filtered_lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] < 0.2 * filtered_lineitem_df['AVG_QUANTITY']]

# Calculate the average yearly extended price
filtered_lineitem_df['YEARLY_EXTENDED_PRICE'] = filtered_lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] / 7.0

# Group by part key and calculate the average
results = filtered_lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['YEARLY_EXTENDED_PRICE'].mean().reset_index()

# Write the result to csv file
results.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. The bash script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Python and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis
