The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the shipping date falls between September 1, 1995, and September 30, 1995. The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the python code (execute_query.py):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import direct_redis

# MongoDB connection and query
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# Date range for the query
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 9, 30)

# Query lineitem collection
lineitem_query = {
    'L_SHIPDATE': {
        '$gte': start_date,
        '$lte': end_date
    }
}
lineitems_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find(lineitem_query, projection={'_id': False})))

# Redis connection and query
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
part_data = redis_client.get('part')
part_df = pd.read_msgpack(part_data)

# Filter parts with PROMO
promo_parts_df = part_df[part_df['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('PROMO')]

# Merge lineitems with promo parts
promo_revenue_df = lineitems_df[lineitems_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(promo_parts_df['P_PARTKEY'])]
promo_revenue_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'] = promo_revenue_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - promo_revenue_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate total adjusted revenue
lineitems_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'] = lineitems_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitems_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
total_revenue = lineitems_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'].sum()
promo_revenue = promo_revenue_df['ADJUSTED_PRICE'].sum()

# Calculate the promotional revenue percentage
promo_revenue_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Save results to CSV
result_df = pd.DataFrame({'PROMO_REVENUE_PERCENTAGE': [promo_revenue_percentage]})
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct-redis
