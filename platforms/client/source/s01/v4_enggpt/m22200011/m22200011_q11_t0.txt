The analysis considers the supply cost and available quantity for each part. The results aim to identify parts where the total value (calculated as the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity) exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'partsupp,' 'supplier,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, and nations. The focus is specifically on suppliers in Germany ('N_NAME' is 'GERMANY').\n\nThe results are grouped by part key, and a filtering condition ('HAVING') is applied to select only those groups where the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity surpasses a certain percentage of the overall value for Germany-based suppliers. This threshold is calculated in a subquery.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the calculated value, providing insights into the parts with the highest values that meet the specified conditions for suppliers in Germany.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is a Python script that gathers and processes the data from MySQL and Redis to execute your user's query:

```python
# mysql_redis_query.py

import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Global variables for the database connections
mysql_connection_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
    'charset': 'utf8mb4',
    'cursorclass': pymysql.cursors.Cursor
}

redis_connection_info = {
    'host': 'redis',
    'port': 6379,
}

# Connect to MySQL and query the necessary tables
def query_mysql():
    connection = pymysql.connect(**mysql_connection_info)
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            supplier_query = """
            SELECT *
            FROM supplier
            """
            cursor.execute(supplier_query)
            supplier_data = cursor.fetchall()

            partsupp_query = """
            SELECT *
            FROM partsupp
            """
            cursor.execute(partsupp_query)
            partsupp_data = cursor.fetchall()

        # Turn query results into a pandas DataFrame
        supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier_data), columns=[
            'S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_NATIONKEY', 'S_PHONE', 'S_ACCTBAL', 'S_COMMENT'])
        partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(partsupp_data), columns=[
            'PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY', 'PS_AVAILQTY', 'PS_SUPPLYCOST', 'PS_COMMENT'])
    finally:
        connection.close()
    
    return supplier_df, partsupp_df

# Connect to Redis and get the Nation data
def query_redis():
    client = DirectRedis(**redis_connection_info)
    nation_data = client.get('nation')
    nation_df = pd.read_json(nation_data)
    return nation_df

def process_data(supplier_df, partsupp_df, nation_df):
    # Filter for German suppliers
    german_nations = nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'GERMANY']
    german_suppliers = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(german_nations['N_NATIONKEY'])]

    # Merge German suppliers with partsupp data
    merged_df = pd.merge(partsupp_df, german_suppliers, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

    # Calculate total value for each part
    merged_df['TOTAL_VALUE'] = merged_df['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * merged_df['PS_AVAILQTY']
    
    # Calculate the threshold value from the subquery
    threshold_value = merged_df['TOTAL_VALUE'].sum() * 0.01  # Assuming a threshold of 1% of the overall value

    # Group by part key and apply filtering condition
    result = merged_df.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').filter(lambda x: x['TOTAL_VALUE'].sum() > threshold_value)

    # Sort the result
    result = result.sort_values(by='TOTAL_VALUE', ascending=False)

    # Selecting the relevant columns for output
    result = result[['PS_PARTKEY', 'TOTAL_VALUE']]

    return result

# Main Function to execute the overall process
def main():
    supplier_df, partsupp_df = query_mysql()
    nation_df = query_redis()
    processed_result = process_data(supplier_df, partsupp_df, nation_df)
    processed_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Execute the script
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

And here's the bash script to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql pandas redis direct_redis
```

You would need to run the bash script first to install the dependencies and then run the Python script to perform the query and write the output to `query_output.csv`. Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine before running these scripts.
