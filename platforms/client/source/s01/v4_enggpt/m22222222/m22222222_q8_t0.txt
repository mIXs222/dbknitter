The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the year of the order and the calculated market share, specifically focusing on the nation 'INDIA.'\n\nTo achieve this, data is derived from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between parts, suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations and regions. The focus is on the 'ASIA' region and the specific part type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER.'\n\nFor each order, the volume is calculated as the extended price of line items adjusted for discounts. The volume is associated with the respective nation, considering the 'INDIA' nation. The results are then grouped by the year of the order.\n\nThe market share is computed by summing the volumes associated with 'INDIA' and dividing it by the total volume. This provides a detailed understanding of the market share dynamics for the specified part type within the 'ASIA' region, specifically highlighting the contribution of 'INDIA' over the years 1995 and 1996.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of market share trends for the 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' part in the 'ASIA' region during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (analysis.py) that would handle this query, assuming you have the correct access to each underlying data platform. Note that as Redis doesn't inherently support SQL-like operations, significant data processing needs to be done in Python using the pandas library to replicate the SQL logic:

```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to Redis
redis_host = "redis"
redis_port = 6379
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port)

# Retrieve data from Redis
def get_df(key):
    data = r.get(key)
    return pd.read_json(data)

df_nation = get_df('nation')
df_region = get_df('region')
df_part = get_df('part')
df_supplier = get_df('supplier')
df_orders = get_df('orders')
df_lineitem = get_df('lineitem')
df_customer = get_df('customer')

# Perform the necessary filtering and join operations
df_part = df_part[df_part['P_TYPE'] == 'SMALL PLATED COPPER']
df_region = df_region[df_region['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA']

# Combining dataframes based on keys
merged_df1 = pd.merge(df_supplier, df_nation, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
merged_df2 = pd.merge(merged_df1, df_region, left_on='N_REGIONKEY', right_on='R_REGIONKEY')
merged_df3 = pd.merge(df_lineitem, df_part, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
merged_df4 = pd.merge(merged_df3, merged_df2, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_df4, df_orders, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')
final_merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, df_customer, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Filter for specific nation 'INDIA' and years 1995 to 1996
final_merged_data = final_merged_data[
    (final_merged_data['N_NAME'] == 'INDIA') &
    (final_merged_data['O_ORDERDATE'] >= pd.Timestamp('1995-01-01')) &
    (final_merged_data['O_ORDERDATE'] <= pd.Timestamp('1996-12-31'))
]

# Calculate volume
final_merged_data['VOLUME'] = final_merged_data['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - final_merged_data['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group by year and calculate market share
final_merged_data['YEAR'] = final_merged_data['O_ORDERDATE'].dt.year
volume_by_year = final_merged_data.groupby('YEAR')['VOLUME'].sum().reset_index()
total_volume_by_year = final_merged_data.groupby('YEAR')['VOLUME'].transform('sum')
final_merged_data['MARKET_SHARE'] = final_merged_data['VOLUME'] / total_volume_by_year

# Selecting required columns and sorting
market_share_by_year = final_merged_data[['YEAR', 'MARKET_SHARE']].drop_duplicates().sort_values('YEAR')

# Write output to csv
market_share_by_year.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

To install all the necessary dependencies, here's the Bash script (setup.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system
sudo apt-get update -y

# Install Python 3 and PIP (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pandas redis

# Install direct_redis (assuming it's available in PIP or replace with correct source)
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Make sure to mark this Bash script as executable with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Remember to use your actual authentication credentials and process for connecting to Redis; the provided Python script assumes a simplified library `direct_redis.DirectRedis`, which may not exist in reality. You'd typically use the Python package `redis` or another appropriate library instead, and handle the serialization/deserialization of data yourself.
