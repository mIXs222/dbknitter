The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you asked for:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Redis connection and query
redis_hostname = 'redis'
redis_port = 6379
redis_db = 0

# Establish Redis connection
r = DirectRedis(host=redis_hostname, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)

# Load data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(r.get('customer'))
orders_df = pd.read_json(r.get('orders'))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(r.get('lineitem'))

# Convert columns with dates to datetime
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])

# Filter the dataframes based on the given conditions
customer_build_df = customer_df[customer_df['C_MKTSEGMENT'] == 'BUILDING']
orders_before_date_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] < '1995-03-15']
lineitem_after_date_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] > '1995-03-15']

# Merge the dataframes to create a combined dataset
merged_df = customer_build_df.merge(orders_before_date_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(lineitem_after_date_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Compute the revenue and assign as a new field
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group by O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_SHIPPRIORITY and calculate total revenue
result_df = merged_df.groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'], as_index=False)['REVENUE'].sum()

# Sort the results by REVENUE descending and O_ORDERDATE ascending
result_df = result_df.sort_values(by=['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write the results to a CSV file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the corresponding Bash script for installing the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure pip is available
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

# Install necessary Python packages
pip install pandas
pip install direct_redis
```

Please make sure to run the Bash script before executing the Python code to install all necessary dependencies.
