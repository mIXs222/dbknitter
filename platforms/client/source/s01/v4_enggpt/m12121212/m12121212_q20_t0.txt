The analysis involves multiple nested subqueries and focuses on suppliers located in Canada ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers and nations. The main selection criteria are defined within a set of subqueries:\n\nIdentify suppliers whose supplier keys ('S_SUPPKEY') are in the set of supplier keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery filters suppliers based on parts available in specific conditions.\nThe second subquery identifies part keys ('PS_PARTKEY') from the 'partsupp' table where the associated part names ('P_NAME') start with 'forest.'\nThe third subquery calculates a threshold quantity as 50% of the sum of line item quantities for a specific part-supplier combination, meeting additional conditions like a specific ship date range ('L_SHIPDATE' between '1994-01-01' and '1995-01-01').\nThe main query filters suppliers based on the specified nation ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and addresses ('S_ADDRESS') for suppliers meeting the specified conditions, ordered in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code needed to execute the query (.py):

```python
# import necessary libraries
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to mongodb
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Load mongodb tables
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['nation'].find({}, {'_id': 0})))
part_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['part'].find({}, {'_id': 0})))
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['partsupp'].find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Filter parts provided by Canadian suppliers
canadian_nations = nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'CANADA']
supplier_keys = canadian_nations['N_NATIONKEY'].values.tolist()

# Connect to redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve redis tables as pandas dataframes
supplier_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('supplier'))
supplier_df = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(supplier_keys)]

lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

# Additional filters based on part name and ship date
parts_forest = part_df[part_df['P_NAME'].str.startswith('forest')]['P_PARTKEY'].values.tolist()
lineitem_filtered = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= datetime.strptime('1994-01-01', '%Y-%m-%d')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= datetime.strptime('1995-01-01', '%Y-%m-%d')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(parts_forest))
]

# Compute threshold quantity (50% of total line item quantity)
threshold_qtys = lineitem_filtered.groupby(['L_PARTKEY', 'L_SUPPKEY'])['L_QUANTITY'].sum() * 0.5
threshold_qtys_df = threshold_qtys.reset_index()
threshold_qtys_df.rename(columns={'L_QUANTITY': 'THRESHOLD_QUANTITY'}, inplace=True)

# Match suppliers and threshold quantities
partsupp_filtered = partsupp_df[
    (partsupp_df['PS_PARTKEY'].isin(parts_forest)) &
    (partsupp_df['PS_AVAILQTY'] >= threshold_qtys_df['THRESHOLD_QUANTITY'])
]

# Combine the results to get the final output
final_df = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_SUPPKEY'].isin(partsupp_filtered['PS_SUPPKEY'])][['S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS']]

# Sort by supplier name and write out to file
final_df.sort_values('S_NAME').to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Bash script to install the dependencies needed to run the above Python code (.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct-redis

# Set up DirectRedis
echo "Installing DirectRedis..."

# Clone the repository (Assuming this is necessary due to the custom package)
# git clone https://github.com/some-repo/direct_redis.git
# cd direct_redis
# python3 setup.py install
# cd ..

# Clean up the package list (optional)
apt-get clean
```

Please note, the script assumes a Debian-based system (such as Ubuntu) and that DirectRedis is not available as a typical package, hence it's cloning from a repository. Adjust the repository URL accordingly.
