The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code:

```python
# Python code: execute_query.py

import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']
# Read collections into Pandas DataFrames
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db.nation.find({}, {'_id': 0})))
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db.orders.find({'O_ORDERSTATUS': 'F'}, {'_id': 0})))

# Redis connection
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
# Read data into Pandas DataFrames
supplier_df = pd.read_json(r.get('supplier'))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(r.get('lineitem'))

# Perform analysis
# Filter suppliers located in Saudi Arabia
saudi_nations = nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'SAUDI ARABIA']
saudi_suppliers = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(saudi_nations['N_NATIONKEY'])]

# Merge suppliers with lineitems
supplier_lineitem = pd.merge(saudi_suppliers, lineitem_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='L_SUPPKEY', how='inner')

# Merge the result with orders
orders_lineitem = pd.merge(supplier_lineitem, orders_df, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY', how='inner')

# Additional filtering based on lineitem details
filtered_lineitem = orders_lineitem[(orders_lineitem['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > orders_lineitem['L_COMMITDATE'])]

# Conditions for EXISTS subqueries
def exists_different_supplier(row, dataframe):
    return dataframe[(dataframe['L_ORDERKEY'] == row['L_ORDERKEY']) & (dataframe['L_SUPPKEY'] != row['L_SUPPKEY'])].empty

def not_exists_later_receipt(row, dataframe):
    return not dataframe[(dataframe['L_ORDERKEY'] == row['L_ORDERKEY']) & (dataframe['L_SUPPKEY'] != row['L_SUPPKEY']) & (dataframe['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > row['L_COMMITDATE'])].empty

filtered_lineitem['NOT_EXISTS_LATER_RECEIPT'] = filtered_lineitem.apply(not_exists_later_receipt, axis=1, dataframe=filtered_lineitem)

# Apply subquery filters
final_result = filtered_lineitem[filtered_lineitem['EXISTS_DIFF_SUPPLIER'] & filtered_lineitem['NOT_EXISTS_LATER_RECEIPT']]

# Group by supplier and calculate waiting times
final_grouped = final_result.groupby('S_NAME').size().reset_index(name='NUMWAIT')

# Sort results
final_grouped_sorted = final_grouped.sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write to CSV
final_grouped_sorted.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the requested Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script: install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python pip and Redis if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip redis-server

# Install pymongo and direct_redis using pip
pip3 install pymongo direct_redis pandas
