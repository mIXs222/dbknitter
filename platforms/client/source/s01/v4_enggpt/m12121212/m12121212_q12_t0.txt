The analysis distinguishes between high-priority ('1-URGENT' and '2-HIGH') and low-priority orders. The results aim to provide a count of line items for each shipping mode falling into these priority categories.\n\nData is sourced from the 'orders' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing a relationship between orders and their corresponding line items. The criteria for selection include matching order and line item keys, specific shipping modes ('MAIL' and 'SHIP'), and ensuring that the commitment date is earlier than the receipt date, the shipping date is earlier than the commitment date, and the receipt date falls between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994.\n\nTwo counts are calculated for each shipping mode:\n\n'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\n'LOW_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders not marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\nThe results are then grouped by shipping mode, offering insights into the distribution of line items based on shipping modes and order priorities. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the shipping mode, providing a comprehensive view of line item counts categorized by shipping mode and order priority.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`.py` file content) for executing the given query:

```python
# Python code: analysis.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongo_db['orders']

# Get orders from MongoDB
orders_query = {
    'O_ORDERDATE': {'$gte': datetime(1994, 1, 1), '$lte': datetime(1994, 12, 31)},
    'O_ORDERPRIORITY': {'$in': ['1-URGENT', '2-HIGH']}
}
high_priority_orders = orders_collection.find(orders_query, {'_id': 0, 'O_ORDERKEY': 1})

# Get the keys of high-priority orders
high_priority_order_keys = [order['O_ORDERKEY'] for order in high_priority_orders]

# Connect to Redis
import direct_redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get lineitem DataFrame from Redis
lineitem_df = redis_client.get('lineitem')

# Filter the lineitem DataFrame
lineitem_filtered_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) &
    (lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'] < lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE']) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
]

# Split into high and low priority based on O_ORDERKEY
lineitem_high_priority_df = lineitem_filtered_df[lineitem_filtered_df['L_ORDERKEY'].isin(high_priority_order_keys)]
lineitem_low_priority_df = lineitem_filtered_df[~lineitem_filtered_df['L_ORDERKEY'].isin(high_priority_order_keys)]

# Count the number of line items in high and low priority for each shipping mode
shipping_mode_counts = {
    'SHIP_MODE': [],
    'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': [],
    'LOW_LINE_COUNT': []
}

for ship_mode in ['MAIL', 'SHIP']:
    shipping_mode_counts['SHIP_MODE'].append(ship_mode)
    shipping_mode_counts['HIGH_LINE_COUNT'].append(len(lineitem_high_priority_df[lineitem_high_priority_df['L_SHIPMODE'] == ship_mode]))
    shipping_mode_counts['LOW_LINE_COUNT'].append(len(lineitem_low_priority_df[lineitem_low_priority_df['L_SHIPMODE'] == ship_mode]))

# Create a DataFrame from the results
result_df = pd.DataFrame(shipping_mode_counts)

# Sort the DataFrame by shipping mode
result_df.sort_values(by=['SHIP_MODE'], inplace=True)

# Write to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close clients
mongo_client.close()
redis_client.close()
```

And here is the corresponding bash script (`.sh` file content) to install all dependencies to run that Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash Script: install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and upgrade existing packages
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MongoDB and Redis clients for Python
pip3 install pymongo direct_redis pandas
