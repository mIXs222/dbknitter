The analysis considers the supply cost and available quantity for each part. The results aim to identify parts where the total value (calculated as the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity) exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'partsupp,' 'supplier,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, and nations. The focus is specifically on suppliers in Germany ('N_NAME' is 'GERMANY').\n\nThe results are grouped by part key, and a filtering condition ('HAVING') is applied to select only those groups where the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity surpasses a certain percentage of the overall value for Germany-based suppliers. This threshold is calculated in a subquery.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the calculated value, providing insights into the parts with the highest values that meet the specified conditions for suppliers in Germany.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's a Python code (`analysis.py`) that performs the analysis specified in the query across the heterogeneous databases:

```python
# analysis.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Define a function to connect to MongoDB and get the table data
def get_mongodb_table_data(collection_name, host='mongodb', port=27017, db_name='tpch'):
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(host, port)
    db = client[db_name]
    collection = db[collection_name]
    data = pd.DataFrame(list(collection.find()))
    return data

# Define a function to connect to Redis and get the table data
def get_redis_table_data(key_name, host='redis', port=6379, db_name=0):
    redis_client = DirectRedis(host=host, port=port, db=db_name)
    data = pd.read_json(redis_client.get(key_name))
    return data

# Get data from MongoDB
nation_data = get_mongodb_table_data('nation')
partsupp_data = get_mongodb_table_data('partsupp')

# Get data from Redis
supplier_data = get_redis_table_data('supplier')

# Merge data to perform analysis
# Filter nations for Germany
germany_nations = nation_data[nation_data['N_NAME'] == 'GERMANY']

# Join supplier with Germany nations to get German suppliers
german_suppliers = supplier_data[supplier_data['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(germany_nations['N_NATIONKEY'])]

# Join partsupp with German suppliers
parts_german_suppliers = partsupp_data.merge(german_suppliers, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Calculate total value for each part (supply cost * available quantity)
parts_german_suppliers['TOTAL_VALUE'] = parts_german_suppliers['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * parts_german_suppliers['PS_AVAILQTY']

# Group by part key and aggregate the values
grouped_parts = parts_german_suppliers.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').agg({'TOTAL_VALUE': 'sum'}).reset_index()

# Calculate the overall value for Germany-based suppliers as the threshold
total_value_threshold = parts_german_suppliers['TOTAL_VALUE'].sum() * (certain_percentage / 100)
filtered_parts = grouped_parts[grouped_parts['TOTAL_VALUE'] > total_value_threshold]

# Order by calculated value in descending order
final_result = filtered_parts.sort_values('TOTAL_VALUE', ascending=False)

# Write final results to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's a bash script (`setup.sh`) to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup.sh

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis
```

Use `chmod +x setup.sh` to make the bash script executable and then run it with `./setup.sh` before executing the Python script.
