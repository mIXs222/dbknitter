The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that fulfills the request:

```python
# analysis.py
import pymongo
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# Connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connection to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve parts data from MongoDB
parts_columns = ['P_PARTKEY', 'P_NAME', 'P_MFGR', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'P_CONTAINER', 'P_RETAILPRICE', 'P_COMMENT']
parts_data = list(mongo_db['part'].find(
    {
        'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'},
        'P_TYPE': {'$not': {'$regex': r'^MEDIUM POLISHED'}},
        'P_SIZE': {'$in': [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]}
    },
    projection={column: 1 for column in parts_columns}
))
df_parts = pd.DataFrame(parts_data)

# Retrieve partsupp data from MongoDB
partsupp_columns = ['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY', 'PS_AVAILQTY', 'PS_SUPPLYCOST', 'PS_COMMENT']
partsupp_data = list(mongo_db['partsupp'].find(
    {},
    projection={column: 1 for column in partsupp_columns}
))
df_partsupp = pd.DataFrame(partsupp_data)

# Retrieve supplier data from Redis and create DataFrame
supplier_data = redis_client.get('supplier')
df_supplier = pd.read_json(supplier_data)
df_supplier = df_supplier[df_supplier['S_COMMENT'].apply(lambda x: 'Customer Complaints' not in x)]

# Merging dataframes
df_merged = pd.merge(df_partsupp, df_supplier, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
df_merged = pd.merge(df_merged, df_parts, left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Grouping and counting suppliers
result = df_merged.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']) \
                  .agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=pd.NamedAgg(column='S_SUPPKEY', aggfunc='nunique')) \
                  .reset_index()

# Sorting the results
result = result.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Output the results to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install the required dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install direct_redis
pip3 install pandas
```

Make sure to set execute permissions on the .sh file:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
``` 

Note: The Redis part assumes the existence of `direct_redis.DirectRedis` and that it has a method `.get()` returning a JSON string that could be read by `pd.read_json`. If `DirectRedis` does not exist or does not have such method, you'd need to adjust the code with the correct library and read method accordingly. The above code also assumes the standard pymongo installation and use. Consider your deployment environment specifics that may require adjustments to installation commands or connection details.
