The analysis focuses on parts with a size of 15 and a type containing 'BRASS.' Additionally, the suppliers of these parts are located in the 'EUROPE' region. The results include the account balance, name, address, phone, and comments of the suppliers, as well as details about the parts, such as part key, manufacturer, and size.\n\nData is sourced from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'partsupp,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, partsuppliers, nations, and regions. The criteria for selection involve matching part and supplier keys, part size and type, supplier nation and region, and the minimum supply cost within the 'EUROPE' region.\n\nThe results are ordered in descending order based on the supplier's account balance, and then in ascending order based on nation name, supplier name, and part key. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of account balances among suppliers, organized by region, nation, supplier name, and part key.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that performs the required operations:

```python
# query.py
import pymongo
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
# Retrieve data from MongoDB collections
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.nation.find()))
part_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.part.find({'P_SIZE': 15, 'P_TYPE': {'$regex': 'BRASS'}})))
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.partsupp.find()))

# Redis connection
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
# Retrieve data from Redis
region_df = pd.read_msgpack(redis_client.get('region'))
supplier_df = pd.read_msgpack(redis_client.get('supplier'))

# Filtering for 'EUROPE' region
europe_region_df = region_df[region_df.R_NAME == 'EUROPE']
# Joining and filtering the dataframe
europe_nation_df = nation_df[nation_df.N_REGIONKEY.isin(europe_region_df.R_REGIONKEY)]

# Filtering suppliers in 'EUROPE'
europe_supplier_df = supplier_df[supplier_df.S_NATIONKEY.isin(europe_nation_df.N_NATIONKEY)]

# Filtering parts based on PS_PARTKEY from partsupp_df and P_PARTKEY from part_df
part_in_partsupp_df = partsupp_df[partsupp_df.PS_PARTKEY.isin(part_df.P_PARTKEY)]
# Finding minimum PS_SUPPLYCOST for each part
min_cost_partsupp_df = part_in_partsupp_df.groupby('PS_PARTKEY')['PS_SUPPLYCOST'].min().reset_index()
# Joining to get part details having the minimum supply cost
min_cost_part_df = pd.merge(min_cost_partsupp_df, part_df, left_on="PS_PARTKEY", right_on="P_PARTKEY")

# Joining to get parts supplied by suppliers in the 'EUROPE' region
europe_supplier_partsupp_df = europe_supplier_df.merge(partsupp_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='PS_SUPPKEY')
# Filtering parts with minimum supply cost from 'EUROPE' region
final_parts_df = europe_supplier_partsupp_df.merge(min_cost_part_df, on=['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPLYCOST'])

# Selecting final columns
final_columns = ['S_ACCTBAL', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE', 'S_COMMENT', 'P_PARTKEY', 'P_MFGR', 'P_SIZE']
final_df = final_parts_df[final_columns]

# Sorting the results as per the query
sorted_final_df = final_df.sort_values(by=['S_ACCTBAL', 'S_NAME', 'P_PARTKEY'], ascending=[False, True, True])

# Saving results to CSV
sorted_final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install.sh
pip install pymongo direct_redis pandas
```

Remember to make the bash script executable by running `chmod +x install.sh`.
