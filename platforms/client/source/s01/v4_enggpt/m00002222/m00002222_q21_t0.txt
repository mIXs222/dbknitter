The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                                   user='root',

JOIN nation n ON s.S_NATIONKEY = n.N_NATIONKEY
WHERE n.N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
"""
suppliers_df = pd.read_sql(supplier_nation_query, mysql_connection)

# Connect to the Redis database

# Use conditions specified for EXISTS subqueries in the original query
merged_df = merged_df[merged_df['L_SUPPKEY'].isin(suppliers_df['S_SUPPKEY'])]

# Group by supplier key and count the number of line items for each supplier
result = merged_df.groupby(['L_SUPPKEY']).size().reset_index(name='NUMWAIT')

# Merge with the suppliers dataframe to get supplier names

# Select the desired columns and sort results as specified

# Write the results to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

### Bash Script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis

# Note: Assuming that direct_redis is a valid package for this context,
# as it is not an existing publicly known Python package.
# You might need to install it from a given source or adjust the script accordingly.
```

Remember to grant execute permissions to the bash script after creating it by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`. Also, ensure that the host machine has access to the `mysql` and `redis` services at the specified hostnames and that the necessary ports are accessible.
