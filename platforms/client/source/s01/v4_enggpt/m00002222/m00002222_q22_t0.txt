message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct a thorough analysis to obtain statistics on customers based on specific criteria related to their phone numbers, account balances, and order history. The analysis aims to summarize the number of customers, their total account balances, and the corresponding country codes.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer' and 'orders' tables. The main selection criteria are defined within a nested subquery:\n\nExtract the country codes ('CNTRYCODE') from the first two characters of customer phone numbers ('C_PHONE') using the SUBSTR function.\nInclude only customers with account balances ('C_ACCTBAL') greater than the average account balance for customers with positive balances in the specified country codes ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21').\nExclude customers who have placed orders using the NOT EXISTS condition.\nThe results, aliased as 'CUSTSALE,' are then aggregated based on country codes ('CNTRYCODE'). The summary includes the count of customers ('NUMCUST') and the sum of their account balances ('TOTACCTBAL'). The presentation orders the results in ascending order based on country codes.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that would execute the pseudo-SQL query you provided on the Redis data platform:

```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv

# Setting up the connection to the Redis database
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetching tables as Pandas DataFrames using the redis client
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('customer'), orient='records')
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'), orient='records')

# Performing the analysis and computations
# Extract the country code from the phone number
customer_df['CNTRYCODE'] = customer_df['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2)

# Filter for specified country codes and positive account balances
specified_country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
customers_positive_balances = customer_df[customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0]
average_balances = customers_positive_balances.groupby('CNTRYCODE')['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().to_dict()
customer_df = customer_df[customer_df['CNTRYCODE'].isin(specified_country_codes)]
customer_df['AVG_C_ACCTBAL'] = customer_df['CNTRYCODE'].map(average_balances)

# Include only customers with balances greater than the average balance for the country
filtered_customers = customer_df[customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > customer_df['AVG_C_ACCTBAL']]

# Exclude customers who have placed orders
customers_with_orders = orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'].unique()
filtered_customers = filtered_customers[~filtered_customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(customers_with_orders)]

# Final aggregation
result = filtered_customers.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg(
    NUMCUST=pd.NamedAgg(column='C_CUSTKEY', aggfunc='size'),
    TOTACCTBAL=pd.NamedAgg(column='C_ACCTBAL', aggfunc='sum')
).reset_index().sort_values('CNTRYCODE')

# Write to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the bash script to set up all dependencies:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Assuming that the code is executed in a Linux environment
# Update the package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pandas redis

# DirectRedis might not be a real package, so this will probably fail
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please keep in mind that as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, `DirectRedis` is not a standard Python package available in public repositories like PyPI, hence the installation using `pip3` in the bash script may not work. The script assumes that such a package exists and can be installed using pip.
