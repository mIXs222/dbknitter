Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: partsupp\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- partsupp: PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY, PS_AVAILQTY, PS_SUPPLYCOST, PS_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct an analysis of parts and their associated suppliers, considering various criteria to filter and group the results. The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

mysql_args = {
    'host': 'mysql',

# Redis connection parameters

# Sorting the results

# Writing the results to a CSV file

```

2. Below is a Bash script for installing all dependencies in a `.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# script.sh

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python3, pip and MySQL server (since pymysql is used)
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip # mysql-server

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pandas pymysql redis direct-redis

# If direct_redis is not available through pip, it needs to be installed through another method, e.g., from source
```

Make sure to execute this bash script with root privileges to ensure all packages can be installed correctly.
