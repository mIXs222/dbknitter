Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (let's name it `query_analysis.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Get the 'part' table from MySQL
part_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_BRAND, P_CONTAINER
FROM part
WHERE P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG';
"""
part_df = pd.read_sql(part_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the 'lineitem' table from Redis and convert to pandas DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(redis_client.get('lineitem')))

# Calculate the average quantity for parts
avg_quantity_df = lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()
avg_quantity_df.rename(columns={'L_QUANTITY': 'AVG_QUANTITY'}, inplace=True)

# Merge part dataframe with lineitem dataframe
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, part_df, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Merge with the average quantity dataframe
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, avg_quantity_df, how='inner', on='L_PARTKEY')

# Filter line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part
filtered_df = merged_df[merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] < 0.2 * merged_df['AVG_QUANTITY']]

# Calculate the sum of extended prices of these line items
sum_extended_price = filtered_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()

# Calculate the average yearly extended price
average_yearly_extended_price = sum_extended_price / 7.0

# Output result to a CSV file
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'Average Yearly Extended Price': [average_yearly_extended_price]})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script (let's name it `install_dependencies.sh`) to install the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list and upgrade packages
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y

# Install python3 and pip3 if they are not already installed
apt-get install python3 -y
apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install Python libraries required by the code
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct_redis
