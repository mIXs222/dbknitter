The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the requested Python code to execute the query: 

1. Python Code (`query_execution.py`):
```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
from datetime import datetime

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Getting data from MySQL
query_customer = """
SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_MKTSEGMENT FROM customer WHERE C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING';
"""
query_lineitem = """
SELECT L_ORDERKEY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_SHIPDATE FROM lineitem WHERE L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15';
"""
customers = pd.read_sql(query_customer, mysql_conn)
lineitems = pd.read_sql(query_lineitem, mysql_conn)

mysql_conn.close()

# Redis connection setup and getting data
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders_df_json = redis_client.get('orders')
orders = pd.read_json(orders_df_json)

# Filtering orders before '1995-03-15'
orders_before_date = orders[orders['O_ORDERDATE'] < datetime(1995, 3, 15)]

# Merging the dataframes to simulate a JOIN
customer_orders = pd.merge(customers, orders_before_date, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
result = pd.merge(customer_orders, lineitems, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Calculating revenue after discounts
result['REVENUE'] = result['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - result['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Grouping by specified columns
grouped = result.groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY']).agg({'REVENUE': 'sum'}).reset_index()

# Sorting as per the query - by revenue descending and order date ascending
sorted_grouped = grouped.sort_values(by=['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Writing to file
sorted_grouped.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Bash Script for dependencies installation (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install Python3 pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Installing necessary Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
