The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the supplier and customer nations, the year of shipping, and the calculated revenue volume.\n\nTo achieve this, data is extracted from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' and 'nation' tables. The relationship between suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations is established. Specifically, the nations involved are 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA,' considering both possible pairs: ('JAPAN' as the supplier nation and 'INDIA' as the customer nation, and vice versa).\n\nThe timeframe of interest for the line items is set between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996. For each line item, the revenue volume is computed as the extended price adjusted for the discount.\n\nThe results are then grouped by supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping. This detailed grouping provides insights into how revenue is distributed over the specified period across different nation pairs and shipping years.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping, offering a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics between suppliers and customers in 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA' during the specified timeframe\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that you need to execute the provided query using data from both MySQL and Redis.

```python
# File: generate_report.py

import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                                   user='root',
                                   password='my-secret-pw',
                                   db='tpch')

# MySQL Query
mysql_query = """

    s.S_NATIONKEY AS SUPPLIER_NATIONKEY, 
    c.C_NATIONKEY AS CUSTOMER_NATIONKEY,

    SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE

    supplier AS s
JOIN 
    lineitem AS l ON s.S_SUPPKEY = l.L_SUPPKEY

"""

# Run MySQL Query
df_mysql = pd.read_sql_query(mysql_query, mysql_connection)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get nation data from Redis
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('nation').decode('utf-8'))

# Get orders data from Redis
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('orders').decode('utf-8'))

# Combine data
df_combined = df_mysql.merge(nation_df, left_on='SUPPLIER_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
df_combined = df_combined.merge(nation_df, left_on='CUSTOMER_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY', suffixes=('_SUPPLIER', '_CUSTOMER'))
df_combined = df_combined.merge(orders_df, left_on='ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Write to CSV
df_combined.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the corresponding bash script to install all dependencies to run that Python code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: setup_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install redis-py, assuming direct_redis is a third-party package 
# Note: If direct_redis is not available in PyPI, ensure you have access to this specific package.
pip3 install redis direct_redis
```

Please note that you just need to run the `setup_dependencies.sh` bash script once to install the dependencies. After that, you can execute the `generate_report.py` Python script to get the desired report as a CSV file. Remember that if `direct_redis` is not publicly available, you would need access to its installation source.
