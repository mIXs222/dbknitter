The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code that you can use to execute the query. Save this code in a file named `query.py`.

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql', 
    user='root', 
    password='my-secret-pw', 
    database='tpch'
)

# Query for supplier table to exclude suppliers with specific comments
supplier_query = """
SELECT DISTINCT S_SUPPKEY
FROM supplier
WHERE LOWER(S_COMMENT) NOT LIKE '%customer complaints%'
"""
suppliers_df = pd.read_sql(supplier_query, mysql_conn)
suppliers_df.rename(columns={'S_SUPPKEY': 'PS_SUPPKEY'}, inplace=True)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# DirectRedis is a placeholder for the actual connection method you need to use for Redis
# Since DirectRedis is not a standard library, this is just an example of how you would use it
# Replace `direct_redis.DirectRedis` with the appropriate connection method to connect to the Redis instance.
import direct_redis

# Connect to Redis and retrieve parts and partsupp tables
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Reading the DataFrame directly from Redis (as per instructions provided)
part_df = redis_conn.get('part')
partsupp_df = redis_conn.get('partsupp')

# Filter the dataframes as per the specified criteria
filtered_part_df = part_df[
    ~(part_df['P_BRAND'].eq('Brand#45')) & 
    ~part_df['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('MEDIUM POLISHED') &
    part_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9])
]

# Merge tables and perform the final analysis
merged_df = pd.merge(partsupp_df, filtered_part_df, on='P_PARTKEY')
final_df = pd.merge(merged_df, suppliers_df, on='PS_SUPPKEY')

# Group by the required attributes and count distinct suppliers
result_df = final_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])['PS_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index(name='SUPPLIER_CNT')

# Order the results as specified in the query
result_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True], inplace=True)

# Write the final dataframe to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script that you can save as `install_dependencies.sh` to install all the required dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assuming you have Python and pip already installed.

# Install pymysql
pip install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip install pandas

# Install SQLAlchemy for easier DataFrame I/O if needed in future
pip install sqlalchemy

# Install any other dependencies needed for DirectRedis as per the documentation.
# Since DirectRedis is not standard, please substitute the following line with the
# actual installation command when you have the correct details.
#pip install direct-redis

# If the script calls for a standard Redis library, like redis-py, install it with:
#pip install redis
