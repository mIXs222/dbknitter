The selection criteria include various sets of conditions, each specified within an 'OR' clause:\n\nFor parts with 'Brand#12' and containers ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG'), quantities between 1 and 11, sizes between 1 and 5, shipping modes ('AIR', 'AIR REG'), and shipping instruction 'DELIVER IN PERSON.'\nFor parts with 'Brand#23' and containers ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK'), quantities between 10 and 20, sizes between 1 and 10, shipping modes ('AIR', 'AIR REG'), and shipping instruction 'DELIVER IN PERSON.'\nFor parts with 'Brand#34' and containers ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG'), quantities between 20 and 30, sizes between 1 and 15, shipping modes ('AIR', 'AIR REG'), and shipping instruction 'DELIVER IN PERSON.'\nThe revenue is calculated as the sum of extended prices adjusted for discounts for all line items meeting the specified conditions.\n\nThe results provide insights into the total revenue generated from line items associated with parts meeting the specified brand, container, quantity, size, shipping mode, and shipping instruction criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
