Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: nation, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- nation: N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME, N_REGIONKEY, N_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nConduct an in-depth analysis to identify suppliers and associated statistics based on various conditions related to order and line item details. The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
