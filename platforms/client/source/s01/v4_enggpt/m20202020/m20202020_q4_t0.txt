The analysis considers not just the number of orders but incorporates a nuanced criterion. Only orders with associated line items where the commitment date precedes the receipt date are included in the count.\n\nFor each order priority, calculate the count of such orders meeting the aforementioned conditions. This detailed examination aims to provide a granular understanding of how order priorities are distributed, taking into account the temporal constraints and the commitment-receipt date relationship of associated line items.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the order priority, offering a clear and insightful portrayal of order priorities and their counts within the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
