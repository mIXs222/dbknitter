The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Below is the Python code that would connect to both MySQL and MongoDB, retrieve and combine data to perform the given analysis, and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_db = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch',
    cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

try:
    with mysql_db.cursor() as cursor:
        # Query parts from MySQL
        mysql_query = """
        SELECT
            P_PARTKEY, P_RETAILPRICE
        FROM
            part
        WHERE
            P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG';
        """
        cursor.execute(mysql_query)
        parts_result = cursor.fetchall()

    # Get lineitem data from MongoDB
    lineitem_result = mongodb.lineitem.find({
        'L_PARTKEY': {'$in': [row[0] for row in parts_result]}
    })

    # Convert MySQL and MongoDB results to DataFrame
    parts_df = pd.DataFrame(parts_result, columns=['P_PARTKEY', 'P_RETAILPRICE'])
    lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_result))

    # Calculate the average quantity for each part
    avg_qty_per_part = lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()

    # Merge the average quantity with lineitem dataframe and filter
    merge_df = lineitem_df.merge(avg_qty_per_part, how='inner', on='L_PARTKEY', suffixes=('', '_AVG'))
    merge_df = merge_df[merge_df['L_QUANTITY'] < merge_df['L_QUANTITY_AVG'] * 0.2]

    # Merge with parts_df to get relevant parts data
    final_df = merge_df.merge(parts_df, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

    # Perform calculation of average yearly extended price
    final_df['AVG_YEARLY_EXTENDED_PRICE'] = final_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] / 7.0

    # Select relevant columns for output
    output_df = final_df[['P_PARTKEY', 'AVG_YEARLY_EXTENDED_PRICE']]

    # Write to CSV
    output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

finally:
    mysql_db.close()
    mongo_client.close()
```

Here is the bash script to install all the dependencies required to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Upgrade packages
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas
