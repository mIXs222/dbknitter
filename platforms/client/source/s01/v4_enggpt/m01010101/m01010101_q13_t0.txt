The analysis distinguishes between customers who have placed orders with specific conditions and those who haven't. The results aim to provide insights into the distribution of customers based on the count of their orders and the presence of certain keywords in the order comments.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer' and 'orders' tables, utilizing a left outer join to ensure all customers are included, regardless of whether they have placed orders or not. The conditions for joining include matching customer and order keys, and the exclusion of orders with comments containing the phrases 'pending' and 'deposits.'\n\nWithin the subquery ('C_ORDERS'), for each customer, the count of orders meeting the specified conditions is calculated.\n\nThe outer query then groups the results by the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). For each count, it calculates the number of customers ('CUSTDIST') with that specific count of orders. The results provide a distribution of customers based on their order counts.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of customers ('CUSTDIST') and, in the case of ties, in descending order based on the count of orders per customer ('C_COUNT'). This ordering offers a comprehensive view of the distribution of customers based on their order counts and the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is a Python code (result.py) that executes the described operation:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_customers = mongo_db['customer']

# Fetch all customers from MongoDB
all_customers = list(mongo_customers.find({}, {'_id': 0, 'C_CUSTKEY': 1}))

# Create a dictionary with customer keys and initialize their order count to 0
customer_orders = {customer['C_CUSTKEY']: 0 for customer in all_customers}

# Query to select orders from MySQL excluding the ones with 'pending' and 'deposits' in the comments
order_query = """
SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) AS C_COUNT
FROM orders
WHERE O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%' AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%deposits%'
GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY;
"""

# Execute the query
mysql_cursor.execute(order_query)
order_results = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Update customer order counts
for order in order_results:
    custkey, count = order
    if custkey in customer_orders:
        customer_orders[custkey] = count

# Generating the final distribution
custdist = {}
for count in customer_orders.values():
    custdist[count] = custdist.get(count, 0) + 1

# Sorting the final distribution
sorted_custdist = sorted(custdist.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], -x[0]))

# Writing results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['C_COUNT', 'CUSTDIST'])
    for count, dist in sorted_custdist:
        writer.writerow([count, dist])

# Closing connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is a Bash script (setup.sh) to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package index
apt-get update

# Install pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python MySQL library (pymysql)
pip3 install pymysql

# Install Python MongoDB library (pymongo)
pip3 install pymongo
```

Make sure to run the bash script with administrative privileges (`sudo`) if required, and give it execution permissions using `chmod +x setup.sh` before running the script.
