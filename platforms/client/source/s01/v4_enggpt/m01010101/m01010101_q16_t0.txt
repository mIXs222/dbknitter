The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the requested Python code and Bash script to address the given scenario:

1. Python Code (query_code.py)

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# MongoDB connection
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Prepare SQL query for MySQL data extraction
mysql_query = """
SELECT p.P_BRAND, p.P_TYPE, p.P_SIZE, PS_SUPPKEY
FROM part p
JOIN partsupp ps ON p.P_PARTKEY = ps.PS_PARTKEY
WHERE p.P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'
AND p.P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
AND p.P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
"""

# Execute MySQL query and fetch data
cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(mysql_query)
mysql_parts = cursor.fetchall()

# Retrieve supplier keys with unwanted comments from MongoDB
unwanted_supplier_keys = set()
for s in mongodb_db.supplier.find({"S_COMMENT": {"$regex": ".*Customer Complaints.*"}}):
    unwanted_supplier_keys.add(s['S_SUPPKEY'])

# Combine results, exclude unwanted suppliers and count suppliers per group
grouped_data = {}
for row in mysql_parts:
    brand, type_, size, supp_key = row
    if supp_key not in unwanted_supplier_keys:
        group_key = (brand, type_, size)
        if group_key in grouped_data:
            grouped_data[group_key].add(supp_key)
        else:
            grouped_data[group_key] = {supp_key}

# Prepare data for CSV export
export_data = [(brand, type_, size, len(suppliers)) for (brand, type_, size), suppliers in grouped_data.items()]
export_data.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[3], x[0], x[1], x[2]))

# Write data to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'SUPPLIER_CNT'])
    for row in export_data:
        writer.writerow(row)

# Close connections
cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

2. Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update repository data and install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python libraries for MySQL and MongoDB
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to set the executable permission for the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`.
