The analysis focuses on parts with a size of 15 and a type containing 'BRASS.' Additionally, the suppliers of these parts are located in the 'EUROPE' region. The results include the account balance, name, address, phone, and comments of the suppliers, as well as details about the parts, such as part key, manufacturer, and size.\n\nData is sourced from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'partsupp,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, partsuppliers, nations, and regions. The criteria for selection involve matching part and supplier keys, part size and type, supplier nation and region, and the minimum supply cost within the 'EUROPE' region.\n\nThe results are ordered in descending order based on the supplier's account balance, and then in ascending order based on nation name, supplier name, and part key. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of account balances among suppliers, organized by region, nation, supplier name, and part key.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the python code (`query_script.py`) that you would use to execute the query:

```python
import csv
import pymysql
import pymongo

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB connection
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Retrieve region 'EUROPE' regionkey from MongoDB
europe_regionkey = mongodb_db.region.find_one({'R_NAME': 'EUROPE'})['R_REGIONKEY'] if mongodb_db.region.find_one({'R_NAME': 'EUROPE'}) else None

# Execute MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT 
  s.S_ACCTBAL, n.N_NAME, s.S_NAME, s.S_ADDRESS, s.S_PHONE, s.S_COMMENT, p.P_PARTKEY, p.P_MFGR, p.P_SIZE 
FROM 
  nation n 
JOIN 
  supplier s ON n.N_NATIONKEY = s.S_NATIONKEY 
JOIN 
  partsupp ps ON s.S_SUPPKEY = ps.PS_SUPPKEY 
JOIN 
  part p ON ps.PS_PARTKEY = p.P_PARTKEY
WHERE 
  n.N_REGIONKEY = %s AND 
  p.P_SIZE = 15 AND 
  p.P_TYPE LIKE '%BRASS'
ORDER BY 
  s.S_ACCTBAL DESC, n.N_NAME ASC, s.S_NAME ASC, p.P_PARTKEY ASC
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query, (europe_regionkey,))

# Write results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as csv_file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
    csv_writer.writerow(['S_ACCTBAL', 'N_NAME', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE', 'S_COMMENT', 'P_PARTKEY', 'P_MFGR', 'P_SIZE'])
    for row in mysql_cursor:
        csv_writer.writerow(row)

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

And the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install python3 and pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to give the bash script execute permissions with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
