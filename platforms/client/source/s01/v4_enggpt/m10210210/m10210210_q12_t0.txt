The analysis distinguishes between high-priority ('1-URGENT' and '2-HIGH') and low-priority orders. The results aim to provide a count of line items for each shipping mode falling into these priority categories.\n\nData is sourced from the 'orders' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing a relationship between orders and their corresponding line items. The criteria for selection include matching order and line item keys, specific shipping modes ('MAIL' and 'SHIP'), and ensuring that the commitment date is earlier than the receipt date, the shipping date is earlier than the commitment date, and the receipt date falls between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994.\n\nTwo counts are calculated for each shipping mode:\n\n'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\n'LOW_LINE_COUNT': The count of line items associated with orders not marked as '1-URGENT' or '2-HIGH' priority.\nThe results are then grouped by shipping mode, offering insights into the distribution of line items based on shipping modes and order priorities. The final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the shipping mode, providing a comprehensive view of line item counts categorized by shipping mode and order priority.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
