The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that fulfills the given query by combining data from MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis:

```python
# Python code for the query
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import direct_redis

# Connecting to MySQL for 'lineitem' table
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
)

# Fetch lineitem data
lineitem_query = """
SELECT L_ORDERKEY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_SHIPDATE
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
"""
lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(lineitem_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connecting to MongoDB for 'orders' table
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Fetch orders data
orders_pipeline = [
    {"$match": {
        "O_ORDERDATE": {"$lt": datetime(1995, 3, 15)}
    }},
    {"$project": {
        "O_ORDERKEY": 1,
        "O_CUSTKEY": 1,
        "O_ORDERDATE": 1,
        "O_SHIPPRIORITY": 1
    }}
]
orders_cursor = mongodb_db.orders.aggregate(orders_pipeline)
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_cursor))
mongodb_client.close()

# Connecting to Redis for 'customer' table
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch customer data
customer_json = redis_conn.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_json(customer_json)

# Filtering customers based on 'BUILDING' market segment
building_customers_df = customer_df[customer_df['C_MKTSEGMENT'] == 'BUILDING']

# Combining the dataframes
combined_df = orders_df.merge(building_customers_df, how='inner', left_on="O_CUSTKEY", right_on="C_CUSTKEY")
combined_df = combined_df.merge(lineitem_df, how='inner', left_on="O_ORDERKEY", right_on="L_ORDERKEY")

# Calculate revenue
combined_df['REVENUE'] = combined_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - combined_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group by order key, order date and shipping priority
grouped_df = combined_df.groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()

# Sort the results
sorted_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write to CSV
sorted_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies needed to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash script for installing dependencies

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Please save the Python code into a file with `.py` extension, and the Bash script into a file with `.sh` extension before executing them. The Python code assumes the Redis data is available in a JSON format that can be directly loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, which might require some data manipulation depending on how data is stored in your Redis database. The direct_redis package also might be hypothetical as there's no standard direct_redis package available; this code assumes such a package exists based on the details given in the question.
