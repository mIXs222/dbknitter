The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results).

response, Below is the Python code that combines data from MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis as described in your question and outputs the result to `query_output.csv`.

**Python Code (.py):**

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from redis.exceptions import DataError
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
cur = mysql_conn.cursor()
cur.execute("""SELECT PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY
               FROM partsupp""")
partsupp_data = cur.fetchall()
cur.close()
mysql_conn.close()
df_partsupp = pd.DataFrame(partsupp_data, columns=['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY'])

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
supplier_collection = mongo_db['supplier']
supplier_data = supplier_collection.find(
    {"S_COMMENT": {'$not': {'$regex': '.*Customer Complaints.*'}}},
    {'S_SUPPKEY': 1}
)
df_supplier = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier_data))

# Try to get data from Redis
try:
    import direct_redis
    redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    df_part = redis_conn.get('part')
except DataError:
    df_part = pd.DataFrame()  # if data not present or error occurs

# Filtering and combining the data
if not df_part.empty:
    df_part_filtered = df_part[
        (df_part['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45') &
        (~df_part['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('MEDIUM POLISHED')) &
        (df_part['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]))
    ]

    # Merge DataFrames on part key
    df = pd.merge(df_part_filtered, df_partsupp, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')

    # Further merge with supplier data on supplier key
    df_final = pd.merge(df, df_supplier, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

    # Calculate the count of distinct suppliers
    df_grouped = df_final.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=('S_SUPPKEY', 'nunique')).reset_index()

    # Sort the results
    df_sorted = df_grouped.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

    # Output the result to a CSV file
    df_sorted.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)

else:
    print("No data found in one of the sources.")

```

**Bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install Python pip if not already installed
sudo apt install python3-pip -y

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Save this bash script as `install_dependencies.sh`, and make sure to give it execute permissions with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
