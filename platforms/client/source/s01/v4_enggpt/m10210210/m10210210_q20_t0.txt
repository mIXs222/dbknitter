The analysis involves multiple nested subqueries and focuses on suppliers located in Canada ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers and nations. The main selection criteria are defined within a set of subqueries:\n\nIdentify suppliers whose supplier keys ('S_SUPPKEY') are in the set of supplier keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery filters suppliers based on parts available in specific conditions.\nThe second subquery identifies part keys ('PS_PARTKEY') from the 'partsupp' table where the associated part names ('P_NAME') start with 'forest.'\nThe third subquery calculates a threshold quantity as 50% of the sum of line item quantities for a specific part-supplier combination, meeting additional conditions like a specific ship date range ('L_SHIPDATE' between '1994-01-01' and '1995-01-01').\nThe main query filters suppliers based on the specified nation ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and addresses ('S_ADDRESS') for suppliers meeting the specified conditions, ordered in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code to execute the query accross the different databases and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# Python code to execute the complex query across different data platforms
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_con = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
mysql_cur = mysql_con.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
nation_collection = mongo_db['nation']
supplier_collection = mongo_db['supplier']

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get data from MySQL
mysql_cur.execute("SELECT PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY FROM partsupp WHERE PS_AVAILQTY > (SELECT 0.5 * SUM(L_QUANTITY) FROM lineitem WHERE L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY AND L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY AND L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1995-01-01')")
ps_result = mysql_cur.fetchall()
ps_df = pd.DataFrame(ps_result, columns=['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY'])

# Get part names from Redis
part_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('part'), orient='records')
forest_parts_df = part_df[part_df['P_NAME'].str.startswith('forest')]

# Combine to get relevant supplier keys
relevant_ps_df = ps_df[ps_df['PS_PARTKEY'].isin(forest_parts_df['P_PARTKEY'])]

# Get supplier information from MongoDB
suppliers_cursor = supplier_collection.find({'S_SUPPKEY': {'$in': relevant_ps_df['PS_SUPPKEY'].tolist()}})
suppliers_df = pd.DataFrame(list(suppliers_cursor))

# Get nation information from MongoDB
canada_nation_cursor = nation_collection.find({'N_NAME': 'CANADA'})
canada_nation_df = pd.DataFrame(list(canada_nation_cursor))

# Combine to get relevant suppliers in Canada
canada_suppliers_df = suppliers_df[suppliers_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(canada_nation_df['N_NATIONKEY'])]
result_df = canada_suppliers_df[['S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS']].sort_values(by='S_NAME').reset_index(drop=True)

# Write to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close connections
mysql_cur.close()
mysql_con.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the requested Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash script to install Python dependencies for running the Python code

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip and Python dev tools
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev -y

# Use pip to install the required libraries
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo redis direct-redis
