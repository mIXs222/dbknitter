Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code (`query_exec.py`):
```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Query to get lineitem data from MySQL
lineitem_query = """
SELECT L_PARTKEY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_QUANTITY
FROM lineitem;
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the data into DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(lineitem_query, mysql_conn)

# Close the MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to the Redis database
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)

# Fetch the 'part' table from Redis and convert the json to DataFrame
part_dict = redis_conn.get('part')
part_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(part_dict)

# Filter the part data for the brand and container type
filtered_part_df = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Calculate the average quantity of parts
average_quantity_df = lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()
average_quantity_df.rename(columns={'L_QUANTITY': 'AVG_QUANTITY'}, inplace=True)

# Join the DataFrame to find less than 20% of the average quantity
filtered_lineitem_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, average_quantity_df, on='L_PARTKEY', how='inner')
filtered_lineitem_df = filtered_lineitem_df[filtered_lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] < (0.2 * filtered_lineitem_df['AVG_QUANTITY'])]

# Join with the filtered part DataFrame to get final filtered results on brand and container type
final_df = pd.merge(filtered_lineitem_df, filtered_part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY', how='inner')

# Calculate the total sum of extended prices and divide by 7.0 to get the average yearly extended price
final_df['YEARLY_AVG_EXTENDED_PRICE'] = final_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum() / 7.0

# Write the result to the output CSV file
final_df[['YEARLY_AVG_EXTENDED_PRICE']].to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Bash script (for a Debian-based Linux distribution) to install all dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python if it's not already installed
command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    sudo apt-get install -y python3
}
# Install pip if it's not already installed
command -v pip3 >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
}

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymysql redis direct-redis

# Ensure the script is executable
chmod +x query_exec.py

# Execute the Python script (optional in the install script, can be run separately)
# python3 query_exec.py
```

The above Python script fetches data from MySQL and Redis databases, performs the required analysis, and outputs the result to a CSV file. The Bash script installs all necessary dependencies for the Python script to run.
