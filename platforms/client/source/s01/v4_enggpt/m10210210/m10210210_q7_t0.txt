The report includes the supplier and customer nations, the year of shipping, and the calculated revenue volume.\n\nTo achieve this, data is extracted from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' and 'nation' tables. The relationship between suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations is established. Specifically, the nations involved are 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA,' considering both possible pairs: ('JAPAN' as the supplier nation and 'INDIA' as the customer nation, and vice versa).\n\nThe timeframe of interest for the line items is set between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996. For each line item, the revenue volume is computed as the extended price adjusted for the discount.\n\nThe results are then grouped by supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping. This detailed grouping provides insights into how revenue is distributed over the specified period across different nation pairs and shipping years.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the supplier nation, customer nation, and year of shipping, offering a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics between suppliers and customers in 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA' during the specified timeframe\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query across different databases and store the output in a CSV file:

```python
# 1. Python Code

import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query for MySQL to retrieve lineitem data
mysql_cursor.execute("""
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS revenue_volume,
    YEAR(L_SHIPDATE) AS ship_year
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'
""")
lineitem_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitem_data, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'revenue_volume', 'ship_year'])

# Query for MongoDB to retrieve orders, supplier, nation data
orders_collection = mongo_db['orders']
supplier_collection = mongo_db['supplier']
nation_collection = mongo_db['nation']

supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(supplier_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0}))
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(nation_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0}))
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0}))

# Retrieve customer data from Redis
customer_data = redis_client.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_json(customer_data)

# Combine the dataframes using merges and filters
merged_df = lineitem_df.merge(orders_df, how='left', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(customer_df, how='left', left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(supplier_df, how='left', left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(nation_df, how='left', left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(nation_df, how='left', left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY', suffixes=('_supplier', '_customer'))

# Filter for 'JAPAN' and 'INDIA' nations
merged_df = merged_df[(merged_df['N_NAME_supplier'].isin(['JAPAN', 'INDIA'])) & (merged_df['N_NAME_customer'].isin(['JAPAN', 'INDIA'])) & (merged_df['N_NAME_supplier'] != merged_df['N_NAME_customer'])]

# Group by and sum revenue
grouped_df = merged_df.groupby(['N_NAME_supplier', 'N_NAME_customer', 'ship_year']).agg({'revenue_volume': 'sum'}).reset_index()

# Sort the results
sorted_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['N_NAME_supplier', 'N_NAME_customer', 'ship_year'])

# Write to CSV
sorted_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close all connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
redis_client.connection_pool.disconnect()
```

And below is the bash script required to install all the dependencies:

```bash
# 2. Bash Script

#!/bin/bash

# Install Python and pip if they aren't already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
