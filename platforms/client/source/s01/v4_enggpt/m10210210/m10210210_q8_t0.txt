The analysis spans the years between 1995 and 1996. The report includes the year of the order and the calculated market share, specifically focusing on the nation 'INDIA.'\n\nTo achieve this, data is derived from the 'part,' 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' 'customer,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between parts, suppliers, line items, orders, customers, and their respective nations and regions. The focus is on the 'ASIA' region and the specific part type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER.'\n\nFor each order, the volume is calculated as the extended price of line items adjusted for discounts. The volume is associated with the respective nation, considering the 'INDIA' nation. The results are then grouped by the year of the order.\n\nThe market share is computed by summing the volumes associated with 'INDIA' and dividing it by the total volume. This provides a detailed understanding of the market share dynamics for the specified part type within the 'ASIA' region, specifically highlighting the contribution of 'INDIA' over the years 1995 and 1996.\n\nFinally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the year of the order, offering a comprehensive overview of market share trends for the 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' part in the 'ASIA' region during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

2. Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install all dependencies for the python script

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Since 'direct_redis' is not a standard package and doesn't exist as of the knowledge cutoff date (2023)
# Assuming it is a custom or local package that needs to be installed separately, 
# appropriate steps would be needed to install this package.
