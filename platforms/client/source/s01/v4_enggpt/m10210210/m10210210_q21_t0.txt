The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the python code (`query.py`) that executes the query:

    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
    charset='utf8mb4')

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

try:
    cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

    # Fetch lineitem table from mysql
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM lineitem")
    lineitems = cursor.fetchall()

    # Assigning lineitem to a dict for easy access based on L_SUPPKEY
    lineitem_dict = {}
    for lineitem in lineitems:
        if lineitem[2] not in lineitem_dict:
            lineitem_dict[lineitem[2]] = []
        lineitem_dict[lineitem[2]].append(lineitem)

    # Fetch nation and supplier table from mongodb
    nations = list(mongo_db.nation.find({"N_NAME": "SAUDI ARABIA"}))

                    # Check for other suppliers condition
                    other_suppliers_exist = any(l2[2] != l_item[2] for l2 in lineitem_dict[order['O_ORDERKEY']])

                        results.append((supplier_dict[l_item[2]]['S_NAME'], wait_count))

    # Remove duplicates and sort the results
    results = list(set(results))
    results.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))

    # Write results to a CSV file
    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csv_writer.writerow(['S_NAME', 'NUMWAIT'])
        for result in results:
            csv_writer.writerow(result)

finally:
    mysql_conn.close()
    mongo_client.close()
```

The bash script (`setup.sh`) to install all dependencies is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not present
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql

# Install PyMongo
pip3 install pymongo
```

To run these scripts, you would save the Python code in `query.py` and the bash script in `setup.sh`, set the appropriate execute permissions for the bash script using `chmod +x setup.sh`, then run the installation with `./setup.sh` and execute the Python script using `python3 query.py`.
