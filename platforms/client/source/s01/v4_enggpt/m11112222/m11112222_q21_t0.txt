The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the given query:

```python
# mongo_queries.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import redis
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Redis connection
r = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# DirectRedis client wrapper to read Pandas DataFrame
def read_redis_df(key):
    data = r.get(key)
    if data:
        return pd.read_json(data)
    else:
        return pd.DataFrame()

# Fetch tables from mongodb
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.supplier.find({"S_NATIONKEY": {"$in": list(mongo_db.nation.find({"N_NAME": "SAUDI ARABIA"}, {"N_NATIONKEY": 1}))}})))
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.nation.find()))

# Fetch tables from redis
orders_df = read_redis_df('orders')
lineitem_df = read_redis_df('lineitem')

# Filter orders with order status 'F'
orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERSTATUS'] == 'F']

# Join tables and perform filters
result = (
    supplier_df.merge(lineitem_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='L_SUPPKEY')
    .merge(orders_df, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')
    .merge(nation_df, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
)

# Further filter based on commit and receipt dates
result = result[result['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > result['L_COMMITDATE']]

# Group by suppliers, count waiting times and sort results
result = result.groupby('S_NAME').agg(NUMWAIT=('L_ORDERKEY', 'count')).reset_index()
result = result.sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])

# Output to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the corresponding Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install MongoDB dependencies
apt-get install -y mongodb-clients

# Install Redis dependencies
apt-get install -y redis-tools

# Install Python and pip for Python packages
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis
```

Please remember to set the appropriate execution permissions for the bash script using the `chmod` command before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Then you can run the bash script to install the dependencies before executing the Python script:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

After running the bash script to install dependencies, you can execute the Python script to perform the query and write the output to `query_output.csv`. 

In a real-world scenario, you would also ensure that any dependencies Python packages are of the correct version that supports the current code, by using a `requirements.txt` file or similar. It's also important to note that the above script assumes that the Redis tables are stored in a serialized Pandas DataFrame format, which might not usually be the case for Redis.
