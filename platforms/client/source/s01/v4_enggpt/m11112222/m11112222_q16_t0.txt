The analysis focuses on parts and their corresponding suppliers, excluding specific conditions related to part brand, type, size, and supplier comments.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'partsupp' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and their suppliers. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and partsupplier keys, and applying various filters:\n\nExclude parts with a brand of 'Brand#45.'\nExclude parts with a type starting with 'MEDIUM POLISHED.'\nInclude parts with specific sizes (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9).\nExclude suppliers with keys associated with comments containing the phrase 'Customer Complaints.'\nThe results are grouped by brand ('P_BRAND'), type ('P_TYPE'), and size ('P_SIZE'). For each unique combination of brand, type, and size, the count of distinct suppliers ('SUPPLIER_CNT') is calculated.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the count of suppliers, and, in the case of ties, in ascending order based on brand, type, and size. This ordering provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of suppliers for different combinations of part brand, type, and size, meeting the specified conditions.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code to execute the provided query on the different data platforms and combine the results to write to `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import re
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
parts_collection = mongo_db["part"]
supplier_collection = mongo_db["supplier"]

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get parts data from MongoDB
parts_query = {
    "$and": [
        {"P_BRAND": {"$ne": "Brand#45"}},
        {"P_TYPE": {"$not": re.compile(r'^MEDIUM POLISHED')}},
        {"P_SIZE": {"$in": [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]}},
    ]
}
parts_projection = {"_id": False}
parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(parts_collection.find(parts_query, parts_projection)))

# Get partsupp data from Redis
partsupp_df = pd.read_msgpack(redis_client.get('partsupp'))

# Get supplier data from MongoDB and filter by comments
supplier_query = {"S_COMMENT": {"$not": re.compile(r'Customer Complaints')}}
supplier_projection = {"_id": False}
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier_collection.find(supplier_query, supplier_projection)))

# Merge dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(partsupp_df, parts_df, left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, supplier_df, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Perform aggregation and grouping
results = (
    merged_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])
    .agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=pd.NamedAgg(column="S_SUPPKEY", func="nunique"))
    .reset_index()
)

# Sort the results
sorted_results = results.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'],
                                     ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write the results to CSV
sorted_results.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Here is a bash script to install all dependencies required to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and redis
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis

# Additional dependencies may be needed if using direct_redis or other redis libraries
# Install them appropriately as per your requirement
pip3 install direct_redis

# Note: The direct_redis package may not exist in the Python Package Index. Normally,
# you would use `redis-py` client. However, this script includes `direct_redis` because
# it was specified in the request. In a practical scenario, you may need to clarify this
# dependency or install it from a specific source if it's a custom or proprietary library.
```

Please execute the bash script with sufficient privileges (`sudo` if needed) before running the Python code.
