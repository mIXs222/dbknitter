Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Below is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# Connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
part_collection = mongodb['part']

# Query parts from MongoDB
pipeline = [
    {'$project': {
        '_id': 0,
        'P_PARTKEY': 1,
        'P_NAME': 1,
        'P_MFGR': 1,
        'P_BRAND': 1,
        'P_TYPE': 1,
        'P_SIZE': 1,
        'P_CONTAINER': 1,
        'P_RETAILPRICE': 1,
        'P_COMMENT': 1
    }},
    {'$match': {
        'P_BRAND': 'Brand#23',
        'P_CONTAINER': 'MED BAG'
    }}
]

parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part_collection.aggregate(pipeline)))

# Connection to Redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query lineitem from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(r.get('lineitem'))

# Merge and perform the analysis
result = pd.merge(
    lineitem_df,
    parts_df,
    how='inner',
    left_on='L_PARTKEY',
    right_on='P_PARTKEY'
)

# Calculate the average quantity for each part
avg_quantity = result.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()
avg_quantity.rename(columns={'L_QUANTITY': 'AVG_QUANTITY'}, inplace=True)

# Join to filter lineitem by 20% of the average quantity
result = pd.merge(
    result,
    avg_quantity,
    how='left',
    on='L_PARTKEY'
)
result = result[result['L_QUANTITY'] < (result['AVG_QUANTITY'] * 0.20)]

# Calculate the average yearly extended price
result['YEARLY_EXTENDEDPRICE'] = result['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] / 7.0
final_result = result.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_CONTAINER'])['YEARLY_EXTENDEDPRICE'].mean().reset_index()

# Write to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Below is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# creates a python virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

# activates the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# upgrade pip to its latest version
pip install --upgrade pip

# install pymongo
pip install pymongo

# install pandas
pip install pandas

# install redis and direct_redis
pip install redis direct_redis
```

Please ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system before running this Bash script, and adjust the script as per your specific environment setup if necessary. Also, remember that for the Redis part of the script to work, you need `direct_redis` which may be a hypothetical module for the purpose of this question. In a real-world scenario, you would use `redis-py` and handle serialization/deserialization manually.
