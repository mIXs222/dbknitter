The analysis considers the supply cost and available quantity for each part. The results aim to identify parts where the total value (calculated as the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity) exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'partsupp,' 'supplier,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between parts, suppliers, and nations. The focus is specifically on suppliers in Germany ('N_NAME' is 'GERMANY').\n\nThe results are grouped by part key, and a filtering condition ('HAVING') is applied to select only those groups where the sum of the supply cost multiplied by the available quantity surpasses a certain percentage of the overall value for Germany-based suppliers. This threshold is calculated in a subquery.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on the calculated value, providing insights into the parts with the highest values that meet the specified conditions for suppliers in Germany.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
