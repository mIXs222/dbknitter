message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nRetrieve detailed insights into order priorities during a specific timeframe from July 1, 1993, to October 1, 1993. The analysis considers not just the number of orders but incorporates a nuanced criterion. Only orders with associated line items where the commitment date precedes the receipt date are included in the count.\n\nFor each order priority, calculate the count of such orders meeting the aforementioned conditions. This detailed examination aims to provide a granular understanding of how order priorities are distributed, taking into account the temporal constraints and the commitment-receipt date relationship of associated line items.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in ascending order based on the order priority, offering a clear and insightful portrayal of order priorities and their counts within the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connection settings
hostname = 'redis'
port = 6379
database_name = '0'

# Connect to Redis
client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=hostname, port=port, db=database_name)

# Read orders and lineitem tables from Redis
orders = pd.DataFrame(client.get('orders'))
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(client.get('lineitem'))

# Convert columns to appropriate datatypes
orders['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders['O_ORDERDATE'])
lineitem['L_COMMITDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem['L_COMMITDATE'])
lineitem['L_RECEIPTDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem['L_RECEIPTDATE'])

# Filter necessary timeframe
orders_timeframe = orders.loc[(orders['O_ORDERDATE'] >= '1993-07-01') & (orders['O_ORDERDATE'] <= '1993-10-01')]

# Select line items with a commitment date before the receipt date
committed_lineitems = lineitem.loc[lineitem['L_COMMITDATE'] < lineitem['L_RECEIPTDATE']]

# Join orders with the subset of line items
filtered_orders = orders_timeframe.merge(committed_lineitems, how='inner', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Count orders per priority after filtering
order_count_by_priority = filtered_orders.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY', as_index=False)['O_ORDERKEY'].nunique()

# Sort results based on order priority
sorted_order_count = order_count_by_priority.sort_values(by='O_ORDERPRIORITY')

# Write to CSV file
