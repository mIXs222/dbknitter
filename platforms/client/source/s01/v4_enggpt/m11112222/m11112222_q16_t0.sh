# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and redis
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis

# Additional dependencies may be needed if using direct_redis or other redis libraries
# Install them appropriately as per your requirement
pip3 install direct_redis

# Note: The direct_redis package may not exist in the Python Package Index. Normally,
# you would use `redis-py` client. However, this script includes `direct_redis` because
# it was specified in the request. In a practical scenario, you may need to clarify this
# dependency or install it from a specific source if it's a custom or proprietary library.
