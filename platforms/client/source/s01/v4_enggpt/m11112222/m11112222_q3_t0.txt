The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the required Python code (query_execution.py):
```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Define connection configuration for Redis
config = {
    'host': 'redis',
    'port': 6379,
    'db': 0
}

# Instantiate a DirectRedis object
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(**config)

# Retrieve data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('customer'), orient='records')
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'), orient='records')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Convert dates to datetime format for comparison
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])

# Filter datasets based on given criteria
customer_build_seg = customer_df[customer_df['C_MKTSEGMENT'] == 'BUILDING']
orders_before_date = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] < '1995-03-15']
lineitem_after_date = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] > '1995-03-15']

# Merge datasets
merged_df = customer_build_seg.merge(orders_before_date, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(lineitem_after_date, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Calculate revenue
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group by required fields and sum up revenue
grouped_df = merged_df.groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'], as_index=False)['REVENUE'].sum()

# Order results based on revenue (descending) and order date (ascending)
result_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write the results to a CSV file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the corresponding Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install dependencies:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3

# Install pip for Python3 if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install pandas
pip install pandas

# Install direct_redis module (assuming it is available through pip)
pip install direct_redis
```

Please ensure you make the Bash script executable by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
