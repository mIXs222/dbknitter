The analysis focuses on orders placed between October 1, 1993, and December 31, 1993, where the line items were marked with a return flag 'R.' The results aim to provide detailed insights into the revenue generated by customers meeting these criteria.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' 'lineitem,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, line items, and nations. The criteria for selection involve matching customer and order keys, considering specific order date constraints, line items marked for return, and associating the customer with their nation.\n\nFor each unique customer, the analysis includes:\n\nCustomer key ('C_CUSTKEY').\nCustomer name ('C_NAME').\nTotal revenue generated, calculated as the sum of extended prices adjusted for discounts ('REVENUE').\nCustomer account balance ('C_ACCTBAL').\nNation name ('N_NAME').\nCustomer address ('C_ADDRESS').\nCustomer phone number ('C_PHONE').\nCustomer comments ('C_COMMENT').\nThe results are then grouped by various customer attributes, including customer key, name, account balance, phone number, nation name, address, and comments. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue and customer information. Finally, the presentation orders the results in ascending order based on revenue, customer key, name, and in descending order based on the account balance, providing a comprehensive view of customer revenue and associated details during the specified time frame.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code you requested:

```python
# query.py
import pymongo
import redis
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# MongoDB connection
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = client["tpch"]
nation_collection = mongodb["nation"]

# Redis connection
r = DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from MongoDB
nations = pd.DataFrame(list(nation_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Fetch data from Redis, converting to Pandas DataFrames
customers_df = pd.read_json(r.get("customer"))
orders_df = pd.read_json(r.get("orders"))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(r.get("lineitem"))

# Filtering the data
filtered_orders = orders_df[
    (orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] >= '1993-10-01') &
    (orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] <= '1993-12-31')
]
filtered_lineitem = lineitem_df[
    lineitem_df['L_RETURNFLAG'] == 'R'
]

# Merging the datasets
merged_df = pd.merge(customers_df, filtered_orders, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, filtered_lineitem, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, nations, left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Calculating revenue
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Aggregating by customer
aggregated_data = merged_df.groupby([
    'C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'N_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 'C_PHONE', 'C_COMMENT'
]).agg({
    'REVENUE': 'sum'
}).reset_index()

# Sorting the results
sorted_data = aggregated_data.sort_values(
    by=['REVENUE', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ACCTBAL'],
    ascending=[True, True, True, False]
)

# Writing the result to a CSV file
sorted_data.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update apt-get and Install python3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required packages
pip3 install pymongo redis pandas direct-redis
