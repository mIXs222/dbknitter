The analysis aims to identify customers, orders, and line items where the total quantity of items in an order exceeds 300 units.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve the following:\n\nSelection of orders where the order key is in the set of order keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery identifies order keys with a total quantity of items exceeding 300.\nMatching customer key in orders and line items.\nMatching order key in orders and line items.\nThe subquery calculates the total quantity of items per order key and selects only those order keys where the total quantity exceeds 300.\n\nThe main query then retrieves information such as customer name ('C_NAME'), customer key ('C_CUSTKEY'), order key ('O_ORDERKEY'), order date ('O_ORDERDATE'), total price of the order ('O_TOTALPRICE'), and the sum of quantities of items in the line items associated with each order.\n\nThe results are grouped by customer name, customer key, order key, order date, and total price. The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the total price of the order and then by order date. This ordering provides a detailed view of customer orders meeting the specified quantity criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. The Python code to execute the described query in MongoDB using pymongo:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# MongoDB connection parameters
host = 'mongodb'
port = 27017
db_name = 'tpch'

# Connect to the MongoDB server
client = MongoClient(host, port)
db = client[db_name]
    
# Subquery to find orders with total quantity over 300
subquery = db.lineitem.aggregate([
    {"$group": {
        "_id": "$L_ORDERKEY",
        "total_qty": {"$sum": "$L_QUANTITY"}
    }},
    {"$match": {
        "total_qty": {"$gt": 300}
    }}
])

# Extract the qualifying order keys from the subquery results
qualifying_order_keys = set(doc['_id'] for doc in subquery)

# Perform the main query
main_query = db.orders.aggregate([
    {"$match": {
        "O_ORDERKEY": {"$in": list(qualifying_order_keys)}
    }},
    {"$lookup": {
        "from": "customer",
        "localField": "O_CUSTKEY",
        "foreignField": "C_CUSTKEY",
        "as": "customer"
    }},
    {"$lookup": {
        "from": "lineitem",
        "localField": "O_ORDERKEY",
        "foreignField": "L_ORDERKEY",
        "as": "lineitems"
    }},
    {"$unwind": "$customer"},
    {"$unwind": "$lineitems"},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": {
            "C_NAME": "$customer.C_NAME",

            "O_ORDERDATE": "$O_ORDERDATE",
            "O_TOTALPRICE": "$O_TOTALPRICE"
        },
        "sum_qty": {"$sum": "$lineitems.L_QUANTITY"}
    }},
    {"$sort": {
        "_id.O_TOTALPRICE": -1,
        "_id.O_ORDERDATE": 1
    }}
])

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'SUM_QTY']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    for doc in main_query:
        writer.writerow({
            'C_NAME': doc['_id']['C_NAME'],
            'C_CUSTKEY': doc['_id']['C_CUSTKEY'],
            'O_ORDERKEY': doc['_id']['O_ORDERKEY'],
            'O_ORDERDATE': doc['_id']['O_ORDERDATE'],
            'O_TOTALPRICE': doc['_id']['O_TOTALPRICE'],
            'SUM_QTY': doc['sum_qty']
        })

# Close the connection to the MongoDB server
client.close()
```

2. The Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo package
pip3 install pymongo
```

Please save each of the above contents as `script.py` and `install_dependencies.sh` respectively, give the bash script executable permissions with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`, and execute the bash script before running the Python code.
