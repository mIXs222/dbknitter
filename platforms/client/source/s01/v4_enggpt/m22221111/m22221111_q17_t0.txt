The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code you requested (`query_code.py`):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# MongoDB connection
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = client["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# Retrieve lineitem data
lineitem_cursor = lineitem_collection.find(
    {}, {'L_PARTKEY': 1, 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE': 1, 'L_QUANTITY': 1}
)

# Convert cursor to DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_cursor))

# Redis connection
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve part data as DataFrame
part_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('part'))

# Filter parts by brand and container
filtered_parts = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Calculate average quantities for each part
avg_quantities = lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()

# Calculate 20% of the average quantities
avg_quantities['avg_20_percent'] = avg_quantities['L_QUANTITY'] * 0.2

# Join lineitem with filtered parts on part key
result_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, filtered_parts, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Join lineitem and parts with average quantities
result_df = pd.merge(result_df, avg_quantities, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')

# Filter lineitem based on less than 20% of the average quantity condition
result_df = result_df[result_df['L_QUANTITY'] < result_df['avg_20_percent']]

# Calculate yearly average extended price
result_df['avg_yearly_ext_price'] = result_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] / 7.0

# Create final output DataFrame
output_df = result_df[['L_PARTKEY', 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'avg_yearly_ext_price']]

# Write the result to a CSV file
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
```

2. Here is the Bash script you requested to install all dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Make sure to give the bash script `install_dependencies.sh` execution permissions with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
