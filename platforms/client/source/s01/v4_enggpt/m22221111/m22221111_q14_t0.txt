The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the shipping date falls between September 1, 1995, and September 30, 1995. The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
from datetime import datetime
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = client.tpch
lineitem_collection = mongodb.lineitem

# Get lineitem data from MongoDB within the timeframe
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 9, 30)

# Query MongoDB for lineitem data in the specified timeframe
lineitem_data = list(lineitem_collection.find({
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lte': end_date}},
    {'_id': 0}
))

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitem_data)

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get part data from Redis
part_keys = redis_client.keys('part*')
part_rows = [eval(redis_client.get(k)) for k in part_keys]
part_df = pd.DataFrame(part_rows)

# Keep only parts with type starting with 'PROMO'
promo_parts = part_df[part_df['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('PROMO')]

# Calculate promotional revenue and total revenue
lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE'] = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Merge lineitem data with promotional parts data
promo_revenue_df = lineitem_df.merge(promo_parts, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate sums
promotional_revenue = promo_revenue_df['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE'].sum()
total_revenue = lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE'].sum()

# Calculate percentage
percentage_promo_revenue = (promotional_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Prepare the output
output = [{
    'Promotional_Revenue': promotional_revenue,
    'Total_Revenue': total_revenue,
    'Percentage_Promo_Revenue': percentage_promo_revenue
}]

# Write output to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=output[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    for data in output:
        writer.writerow(data)

# Close connection
client.close()
```

Now let's see the bash script needed to install the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Ensure that pip, Python development packages, and Redis are installed

# If using apt package manager (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# If using yum package manager (RHEL/CentOS)
#sudo yum update
#sudo yum install -y python3-pip python3-devel

# If using dnf package manager (Fedora)
#sudo dnf install -y python3-pip python3-devel

# Install the necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis
