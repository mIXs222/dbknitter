The analysis aims to quantify the waiting time for suppliers in Saudi Arabia who have fulfilled orders but are still awaiting receipts for those orders.\n\nData is sourced from the 'supplier,' 'lineitem,' 'orders,' and 'nation' tables, establishing relationships between suppliers, line items, orders, and nations. The main selection criteria include various conditions:\n\nMatch supplier keys between 'supplier' and 'lineitem' (aliased as L1), and between 'orders' and 'lineitem.'\nInclude only orders with an order status of 'F' (fulfilled).\nConsider only line items where the receipt date ('L_RECEIPTDATE') is later than the commit date ('L_COMMITDATE').\nUtilize two EXISTS subqueries to filter suppliers based on the presence of other line items for the same order but from different suppliers, and the absence of line items from the same order but from different suppliers where the receipt date is later than the commit date.\nInclude only suppliers located in Saudi Arabia ('N_NAME' is 'SAUDI ARABIA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and the count of line items representing the waiting time ('NUMWAIT'). The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the waiting time and then in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code for your request:

```python

import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Function to get data from MySQL
def get_mysql_data():
    connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            query = "SELECT N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA';"
            cursor.execute(query)
            nations = cursor.fetchall()
    finally:
        connection.close()
    return nations

# Function to get data from MongoDB
def get_mongo_data():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
    db = client.tpch
    suppliers = list(db.supplier.find({"S_NATIONKEY": {"$in": [n[0] for n in get_mysql_data()]}}))
    return suppliers

# Function to get data from Redis and format it as DataFrame
def get_redis_data():
    r = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    orders_df = pd.DataFrame(r.get('orders'))
    lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(r.get('lineitem'))
    return orders_df, lineitem_df

# Combine data from different databases
def combine_data():
    suppliers_data = get_mongo_data()
    orders_df, lineitem_df = get_redis_data()

    # Search for suppliers in the "orders" and "lineitem" dataframes
    orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERSTATUS'] == 'F']
    lineitem_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE']]

    # Create a supplier dataframe
    suppliers_df = pd.DataFrame(suppliers_data)

    # Merge the dataframes to get the final result
    result = (
        suppliers_df.merge(lineitem_df, how='inner', left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='L_SUPPKEY')
        .merge(orders_df, how='inner', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

        .agg(NUMWAIT=('L_ORDERKEY', 'count'))
        .reset_index()
        .sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])
    )

    return result

# Save the result to CSV
result_data = combine_data()
result_data.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager and install pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
