This analysis spans the time period from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1994. The calculation of revenue considers the extended price of line items, accounting for applicable discounts.\n\nTo achieve this, data is drawn from the 'customer,' 'orders,' 'lineitem,' 'supplier,' 'nation,' and 'region' tables. Relationships are established between customers, orders, line items, suppliers, and their respective nations and regions. Only data related to the 'ASIA' region is considered, determined by matching nation and region keys. The time frame is further constrained by including only orders placed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1994.\n\nThe results are then grouped by nation name, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation across different nations within the 'ASIA' region. The grouping is based on the total revenue for each nation, calculated by summing the extended price of line items after discount adjustments.\n\nThe final presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue, providing a detailed breakdown showcasing the nations in the 'ASIA' region, their respective total revenues, and how they contribute to the overall revenue picture during the specified timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the described query:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis using DirectRedis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from MySQL
nation_query = "SELECT * FROM nation"
region_query = "SELECT * FROM region WHERE R_NAME = 'ASIA'"
mysql_cursor.execute(nation_query)
nations = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
mysql_cursor.execute(region_query)
regions = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Convert MySQL data to DataFrame
df_nations = pd.DataFrame(nations, columns=['N_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME', 'N_REGIONKEY', 'N_COMMENT'])
df_regions = pd.DataFrame(regions, columns=['R_REGIONKEY', 'R_NAME', 'R_COMMENT'])

# Fetch data from MongoDB
suppliers = mongo_db.supplier.find()
customers = mongo_db.customer.find()

# Convert MongoDB data to DataFrame
df_suppliers = pd.DataFrame(list(suppliers))
df_customers = pd.DataFrame(list(customers))

# Fetch data from Redis and convert to DataFrame
orders = redis_client.get('orders')
lineitems = redis_client.get('lineitem')
df_orders = pd.read_json(orders)
df_lineitems = pd.read_json(lineitems)

# Filter the data
asia_nations = df_regions.merge(df_nations, left_on='R_REGIONKEY', right_on='N_REGIONKEY')
asia_customers = asia_nations.merge(df_customers, left_on='N_NATIONKEY', right_on='C_NATIONKEY')
filtered_orders = df_orders[(df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] >= datetime(1990, 1, 1)) & (df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] <= datetime(1994, 12, 31))]

# Merge dataframes to prepare for final computation
merged_df = asia_customers.merge(filtered_orders, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(df_lineitems, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(df_suppliers, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Compute the total revenue by nation
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
grouped_revenue = merged_df.groupby('N_NAME')['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()

# Sort the results
sorted_revenue = grouped_revenue.sort_values(by='REVENUE', ascending=False)

# Write the output to a CSV file
sorted_revenue.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Clean up connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run that Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update repository and install Python3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
