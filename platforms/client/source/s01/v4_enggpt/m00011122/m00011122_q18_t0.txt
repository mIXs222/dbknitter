The analysis aims to identify customers, orders, and line items where the total quantity of items in an order exceeds 300 units.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve the following:\n\nSelection of orders where the order key is in the set of order keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery identifies order keys with a total quantity of items exceeding 300.\nMatching customer key in orders and line items.\nMatching order key in orders and line items.\nThe subquery calculates the total quantity of items per order key and selects only those order keys where the total quantity exceeds 300.\n\nThe main query then retrieves information such as customer name ('C_NAME'), customer key ('C_CUSTKEY'), order key ('O_ORDERKEY'), order date ('O_ORDERDATE'), total price of the order ('O_TOTALPRICE'), and the sum of quantities of items in the line items associated with each order.\n\nThe results are grouped by customer name, customer key, order key, order date, and total price. The presentation orders the results in descending order based on the total price of the order and then by order date. This ordering provides a detailed view of customer orders meeting the specified quantity criteria.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code that you can save with the `.py` extension and execute to fulfill the requirement. (e.g., `query_analysis.py`):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Function to connect to MongoDB and retrieve the customer data.
def get_customer_data():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
    db = client['tpch']
    customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(db.customer.find({}, {'_id': 0})))
    client.close()
    return customer_data

# Function to connect to Redis and retrieve the orders and lineitem data.
def get_redis_data():
    r = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    orders_data = pd.DataFrame(eval(r.get('orders')))
    lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(eval(r.get('lineitem')))
    return orders_data, lineitem_data

# Get data from databases
customer = get_customer_data()
orders, lineitem = get_redis_data()

# Process lineitems to find the total quantity per order over 300
lineitem_sum_quantity = lineitem.groupby('L_ORDERKEY').agg({'L_QUANTITY': 'sum'}).reset_index()
lineitem_filtered = lineitem_sum_quantity[lineitem_sum_quantity['L_QUANTITY'] > 300]

# Merge the orders with the filtered lineitems to get the list of orders to consider
orders_filtered = orders.merge(lineitem_filtered, how='inner', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Join the orders with customers
result = orders_filtered.merge(customer, how='inner', left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Calculate sum of quantities for each order and select the required fields
result = result.groupby(['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE']).agg({'L_QUANTITY':'sum'}).reset_index()

# Sort the results as required
result_sorted = result.sort_values(by=['O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write the results to a CSV file
result_sorted.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script (e.g., `setup_dependencies.sh`) that installs all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not available
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct-redis
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the bash script. You can add execution permissions using `chmod +x setup_dependencies.sh`. Then, run the script with `./setup_dependencies.sh` to install dependencies, and run the Python script with `python3 query_analysis.py`.
