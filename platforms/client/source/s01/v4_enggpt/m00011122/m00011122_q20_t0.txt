The main selection criteria are defined within a set of subqueries:\n\nIdentify suppliers whose supplier keys ('S_SUPPKEY') are in the set of supplier keys obtained from a subquery. This subquery filters suppliers based on parts available in specific conditions.\nThe second subquery identifies part keys ('PS_PARTKEY') from the 'partsupp' table where the associated part names ('P_NAME') start with 'forest.'\nThe third subquery calculates a threshold quantity as 50% of the sum of line item quantities for a specific part-supplier combination, meeting additional conditions like a specific ship date range ('L_SHIPDATE' between '1994-01-01' and '1995-01-01').\nThe main query filters suppliers based on the specified nation ('N_NAME' is 'CANADA').\nThe results include supplier names ('S_NAME') and addresses ('S_ADDRESS') for suppliers meeting the specified conditions, ordered in ascending order based on supplier name.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is a Python code that retrieves data from the different sources (MySQL, MongoDB and Redis) and processes them to meet the requirements of the query.

Python Code (`query_analysis.py`):
```python

from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    passwd='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve nation and part data from MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'CANADA'")
    nations = cursor.fetchall()
    nations_df = pd.DataFrame(nations, columns=['N_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME'])

    cursor.execute("SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME FROM part WHERE P_NAME LIKE 'forest%'")
    parts_df = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['P_PARTKEY', 'P_NAME'])

# Retrieve supplier data from MongoDB
supplier_data = mongodb.supplier.find({}, {'_id': 0, 'S_SUPPKEY': 1, 'S_NAME': 1, 'S_ADDRESS': 1, 'S_NATIONKEY': 1})

threshold_quantities_df = threshold_quantities.reset_index()
threshold_quantities_df.columns = ['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY', 'THRESHOLD_QUANTITY']

# Merge to find the suppliers that meet conditions
result_df = filtered_partsupp_df.merge(threshold_quantities_df, on=['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY'])

# Further filter for the final result to ensure quantities are greater than the threshold
result_df = result_df[result_df['PS_AVAILQTY'] > result_df['THRESHOLD_QUANTITY']]

# Final merge to get supplier names and addresses
final_result_df = result_df.merge(canadian_suppliers_df, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Select required columns and sort by supplier name
final_result_df = final_result_df[['S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS']].sort_values(by=['S_NAME'])

# Save to CSV
final_result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close connections
