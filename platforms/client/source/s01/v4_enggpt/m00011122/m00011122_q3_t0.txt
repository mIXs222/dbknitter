The analysis focuses on orders placed before March 15, 1995, with associated line items shipped after March 15, 1995. The computation of revenue involves summing the extended price of line items after applying relevant discounts.\n\nData is sourced from the 'customer,' 'orders,' and 'lineitem' tables, establishing relationships between customers, orders, and line items. Specifically, the analysis includes only orders where the customer's market segment is 'BUILDING,' the order and shipping dates meet the specified criteria, and the customer and order keys are appropriately matched.\n\nThe results are then grouped by order key, order date, and shipping priority. This grouping allows for a detailed breakdown of revenue at the granularity of individual orders, order dates, and shipping priorities. Subsequently, the presentation orders the results in descending order based on revenue and in ascending order based on the order date, providing a comprehensive overview of revenue dynamics for 'BUILDING' segment customers.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code to execute the query across the different databases and combine the results:

```python
# import required libraries
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import redis
from datetime import datetime
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_customers_collection = mongo_db["customer"]

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)

# Filter customers with 'BUILDING' market segment in MongoDB
building_customers_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_customers_collection.find({"C_MKTSEGMENT": "BUILDING"}, {'_id': 0})))

# Get 'orders' and 'lineitem' tables from Redis and convert them to Pandas DataFrames
orders_table = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'))
lineitem_table = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

# Filter orders placed before March 15, 1995, and lineitems shipped after March 15, 1995
filtered_orders = orders_table[(orders_table['O_ORDERDATE'] < "1995-03-15")]
filtered_lineitems = lineitem_table[(lineitem_table['L_SHIPDATE'] > "1995-03-15")]

# Merge all the dataframes into one
merged_df = building_customers_df.merge(filtered_orders, how='inner', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
merged_df = merged_df.merge(filtered_lineitems, how='inner', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Calculate the revenue
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group by order key, order date, and shipping priority
final_df = merged_df.groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()

# Order the results
final_df.sort_values(by=['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True], inplace=True)

# Write the result to 'query_output.csv'
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
```

2. Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis
