The analysis focuses on line items and parts where the shipping date falls between September 1, 1995, and September 30, 1995. The results aim to calculate the promotional revenue as a percentage of the total revenue generated during this period.\n\nData is sourced from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between line items and their corresponding parts. The criteria for selection include matching part and line item keys, and ensuring that the shipping date is within the specified timeframe.\n\nThe calculation involves two components:\n\nThe sum of extended prices for line items with parts whose type starts with 'PROMO' (e.g., 'PROMO1', 'PROMO2'), adjusted for discounts.\nThe total sum of extended prices for all line items during the specified timeframe, also adjusted for discounts.\nThe percentage of promotional revenue is then computed as the ratio of the sum from step 1 to the sum from step 2, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe results provide valuable insights into the proportion of revenue generated from promotional parts compared to the overall revenue during the defined shipping timeframe.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that executes the query:

**query.py**
```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd

# Define MySQL connection parameters
mysql_conn_info = {
    "host": "mysql",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "database": "tpch",
}

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_info)

# SQL query to get 'part' data from MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_TYPE
FROM part
WHERE P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%%'
"""

# Execute query and fetch 'part' data
part_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, con=mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis and fetch 'lineitem' data
# Assuming that direct_redis.DirectRedis can read a Pandas DataFrame using get('lineitem')
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

redis_conn = DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379)
lineitem_df = redis_conn.get('lineitem')
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitem_df)

# Convert string dates to datetime objects for comparison
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])
start_date = pd.to_datetime('1995-09-01')
end_date = pd.to_datetime('1995-09-30')

# Filter 'lineitem' data for the specific timeframe
lineitem_timeframe_df = lineitem_df[(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date)
                                    & (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= end_date)]

# Merge 'part' and 'lineitem' on 'P_PARTKEY' and 'L_PARTKEY'
combined_df = pd.merge(lineitem_timeframe_df, part_df,
                       left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the promotional and total revenues
combined_df['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE'] = combined_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - combined_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
promo_revenue = combined_df[combined_df['P_TYPE'].str.startswith('PROMO')]['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE'].sum()
total_revenue = combined_df['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE'].sum()

# Calculate the promotional revenue percentage
promo_revenue_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Write the output to a CSV file
output_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Promotional Revenue': [promo_revenue],
    'Total Revenue': [total_revenue],
    'Promotional Revenue Percentage': [promo_revenue_percentage]
})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is the bash script to install all dependencies:

**install_dependencies.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install pip for Python 3 if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python Libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas
```

Please make sure that you have execution permission on the bash script file before running it. You can grant execution permission using the command `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`. Also note that the Python script assumes the existence of a library `direct_redis` with a specific function `DirectRedis` which is not a standard library, but as per your instructions, I've assumed its existence and functionality.
