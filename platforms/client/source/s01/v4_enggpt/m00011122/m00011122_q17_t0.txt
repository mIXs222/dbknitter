Additionally, the quantity of these parts in each line item should be less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\n\nThe selection is made from the 'lineitem' and 'part' tables, establishing relationships between parts and line items. The criteria for inclusion involve matching part and line item keys, and applying various filters:\n\nInclude only parts with a brand of 'Brand#23.'\nInclude only parts with a container type of 'MED BAG.'\nInclude only line items where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part across all line items.\nThe main calculation involves summing the extended prices of these line items and then dividing the result by 7.0 to obtain the average yearly extended price.\n\nThe subquery within the quantity comparison calculates 20% of the average quantity for the specific part.\n\nThe final result provides the average yearly extended price for line items meeting the specified conditions based on the 'Brand#23' brand and 'MED BAG' container type.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here's the Python code meeting the requirements (`query_analysis.py`):
```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Establish connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Fetch parts from MySQL with the specified brand and container type
part_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME
FROM part
WHERE P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'
"""
cursor.execute(part_query)
part_result = cursor.fetchall()
part_df = pd.DataFrame(part_result, columns=['P_PARTKEY', 'P_NAME'])
part_keys = part_df['P_PARTKEY'].tolist()

# Establish connection to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get lineitem dataframe from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Calculate the average quantity for each part across all lineitems
avg_quantity = lineitem_df.groupby('L_PARTKEY')['L_QUANTITY'].mean().reset_index()
avg_quantity = avg_quantity.rename(columns={'L_QUANTITY': 'AVG_QUANTITY'})

# Merge to get the average quantity in lineitem dataframe
lineitem_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, avg_quantity, on='L_PARTKEY', how='left')

# Filter lineitem with quantity less than 20% of the average quantity of the same part
lineitem_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] < 0.2 * lineitem_df['AVG_QUANTITY']]

# Combine filtered lineitem with the part dataframe based on the part keys
result_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the average yearly extended price
result_df['AVG_YEARLY_EXTENDED_PRICE'] = result_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum() / 7.0

# Select the required columns for final output
output_df = result_df[['P_PARTKEY', 'P_NAME', 'AVG_YEARLY_EXTENDED_PRICE']]

# Save results to csv
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close database connections
cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
redis_conn.close()
```

2. Here's the bash script to install all dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
pip install pandas
pip install direct_redis
