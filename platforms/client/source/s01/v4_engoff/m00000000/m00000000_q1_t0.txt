Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped before 1998-09-02. The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to perform the requested query on the MySQL database and write the results to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# query.py
import csv
import pymysql

# Connection info
db_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# SQL query text
sql = """
SELECT
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE < '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY
    L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS
ORDER BY
    L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS;
"""

# Connecting to the MySQL database server
conn = pymysql.connect(**db_info)
cur = conn.cursor()

# Executing the SQL query
cur.execute(sql)

# Fetch the results
result_set = cur.fetchall()

# Writing results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    # Writing header
    csvwriter.writerow([i[0] for i in cur.description])
    # Writing the data rows
    csvwriter.writerows(result_set)

# Closing the cursor and the connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

Here's the bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
# install.sh
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
```

Remember to give execute permission to `install.sh` using `chmod +x install.sh` before running it.
