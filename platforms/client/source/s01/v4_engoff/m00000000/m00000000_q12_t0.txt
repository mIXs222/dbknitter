message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmysql has database named tpch with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mysql:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mysql, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- username: root\n- password: my-secret-pw\n- hostname: mysql\n- instruction: Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date. The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode which is MAIL and SHIP, for lineitems actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the required Python code:

db_params = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host=db_params['host'],
                             user=db_params['user'],
                             password=db_params['password'],
                             db=db_params['db'])

try:

        columns = ['L_SHIPMODE', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'LateLineItemCount']

        # Writing to the csv file
        with open(output_file, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            
            # write the header
            writer.writerow(columns)

            # write the data rows
            for row in result:
                writer.writerow(row)
                
    # Committing any pending transaction to the database
    connection.commit()

finally:
    connection.close()

print("Query executed and output written to query_output.csv")
```

Now, for the Bash script that installs all dependencies to run the aforementioned Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Upgrade existing packages
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql package using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to give the Bash script execution permissions before running it:

```sh
chmod +x {script_name}.sh
```

Replace `{script_name}` with the actual name you gave to the Bash script file. Then you can run it with:

```sh
./{script_name}.sh
