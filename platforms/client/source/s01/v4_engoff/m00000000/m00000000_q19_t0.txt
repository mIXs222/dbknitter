Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Discounted Revenue query finds the gross discounted revenue for all orders for three different types of parts. Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the content of the Python script (`query_script.py`) that fulfills the user's request:

```python

    finally:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies necessary to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
```

Please note that this Bash script assumes `pip` is already installed on your system. If `pip` is not available, you'll need to install it first or use your system's package manager to install the Python `pymysql` package. Also, depending on your Python environment, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
