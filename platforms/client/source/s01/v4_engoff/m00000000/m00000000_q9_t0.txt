The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

### Bash script (save as `setup_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install python3 and pymysql

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install python3, pip and MySQL development headers needed for MySQL client library
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip default-libmysqlclient-dev

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to give execution permissions to the bash script by running `chmod +x setup_dependencies.sh`.

To execute the bash script and the Python code, you would run:

```
./setup_dependencies.sh    # This installs the required dependencies.
python3 query_execution.py # This runs the Python script to execute the query and save the results.
