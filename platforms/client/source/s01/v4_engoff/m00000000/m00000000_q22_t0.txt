Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase. This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that will perform the specified query over the MySQL database and write the output to a CSV file named `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymysql
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the connection details for MySQL database
mysql_details = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# Establish a connection to MySQL database
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host=mysql_details['host'],
    user=mysql_details['user'],
    password=mysql_details['password'],
    db=mysql_details['db']
)

try:
    with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # SQL query for MySQL
        seven_years_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365 * 7)).date()
        mysql_query = f"""
            SELECT LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) AS country_code,
                   COUNT(*) AS number_of_customers,
                   AVG(C_ACCTBAL) AS average_balance
            FROM customer
            WHERE LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) IN ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
              AND C_ACCTBAL > 0
              AND C_CUSTKEY NOT IN (
                  SELECT O_CUSTKEY
                  FROM orders
                  WHERE O_ORDERDATE >= '{seven_years_ago}'
              )
            GROUP BY country_code;
        """

        # Execute the query
        cursor.execute(mysql_query)
        rows = cursor.fetchall()

        # Writing the result to CSV
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            writer.writerow(['country_code', 'number_of_customers', 'average_balance'])
            for row in rows:
                writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    mysql_connection.close()
```

And here is the bash script to install all the dependencies to run the above Python code, namely `pymysql`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Please save the Python code into a `.py` file and the bash script into a `.sh` file to run them on your system. Remember to give execute permission to the `.sh` file using the command `chmod +x filename.sh` before running it.
