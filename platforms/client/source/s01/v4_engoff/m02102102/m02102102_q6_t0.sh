# Install custom direct_redis library
# As direct_redis is a hypothetical library for this scenario, a placeholder is used to install it.
# Replace the 'direct_redis_library_link' with an actual library path if available.
# pip3 install git+https://github.com/placeholder_repository/direct_redis_library_link.git

# If the library is hosted on PyPI, it would be installed like this:
# pip3 install direct_redis
