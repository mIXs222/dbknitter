This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments., The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a brand 23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongodb_client['tpch']
part_collection = mongodb['part']

# Query MongoDB for part data
