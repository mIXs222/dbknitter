The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Execute the necessary queries in MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    
    # Query to get nations in GERMANY and their nation keys
    cursor.execute("SELECT N_NATIONKEY FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'GERMANY'")
    german_nation_keys = cursor.fetchall()
    german_nation_keys = [key[0] for key in german_nation_keys]
    
    # Query to get suppliers from GERMANY
    format_strings = ','.join(['%s'] * len(german_nation_keys))
    cursor.execute("SELECT S_SUPPKEY FROM supplier WHERE S_NATIONKEY IN (%s)" % format_strings,
                   tuple(german_nation_keys))
    german_supplier_keys = cursor.fetchall()
    german_supplier_keys = [key[0] for key in german_supplier_keys]
    
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
rds = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get partsupp table and convert to Pandas DataFrame
partsupp_data = rds.get('partsupp')
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(partsupp_data)

# Filter for only parts supplied by German suppliers
filtered_partsupp_df = partsupp_df[partsupp_df['PS_SUPPKEY'].isin(german_supplier_keys)]

# Calculate total value for all parts
filtered_partsupp_df['TOTAL_VALUE'] = filtered_partsupp_df['PS_AVAILQTY'] * filtered_partsupp_df['PS_SUPPLYCOST']

# Find the total value in the dataframe
total_value = filtered_partsupp_df['TOTAL_VALUE'].sum()

# Get parts and their values that represent a significant percentage of the total value
important_parts = filtered_partsupp_df[filtered_partsupp_df['TOTAL_VALUE'] / total_value > 0.0001]

# Select relevant columns and sort by value
important_parts = important_parts[['PS_PARTKEY', 'TOTAL_VALUE']].sort_values(by='TOTAL_VALUE', ascending=False)

# Write to CSV
important_parts.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install pip and Python development package if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install necessary Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql direct_redis pandas
