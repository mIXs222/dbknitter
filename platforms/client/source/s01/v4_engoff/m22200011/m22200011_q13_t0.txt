This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the Python code that accomplishes this task:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
    cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongo_db['orders']

# Fetch customer data from MySQL
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT C_CUSTKEY FROM customer")
customers = {row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()}

# Close MySQL cursor and connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Count orders made by customers from MongoDB
customer_order_counts = {cust_key: 0 for cust_key in customers}
for order in orders_collection.find(
        {"$and": [{"O_ORDERSTATUS": {"$nin": ["pending", "deposits"]}},
                  {"O_COMMENT": {"$nin": ["/.*pending.*/i", "/.*deposits.*/i"]}}]}):
    cust_key = order['O_CUSTKEY']
    if cust_key in customer_order_counts:
        customer_order_counts[cust_key] += 1

# Combine results and write to query_output.csv
distribution_of_customers = {}
for count in customer_order_counts.values():
    distribution_of_customers[count] = distribution_of_customers.get(count, 0) + 1

with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['Number of Orders', 'Count of Customers'])
    for number_of_orders, count_of_customers in sorted(distribution_of_customers.items()):
        csvwriter.writerow([number_of_orders, count_of_customers])
```

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
# setup.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
