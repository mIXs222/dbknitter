This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments., The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a brand 23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code you requested:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = mongo_client["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongodb["lineitem"]

# Get the data from lineitem where P_BRAND is 'Brand#23' and P_CONTAINER is 'MED BAG'
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find({"L_SHIPINSTRUCT": "DELIVER IN PERSON"})))
brand_23_med_bag_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPMODE'].str.contains('TRUCK')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_COMMENT'].str.contains('special')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_COMMENT'].str.contains('packages'))
]

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
part_data = redis_client.get('part')
part_df = pd.DataFrame(part_data)

# Filter the part table
filtered_parts_df = part_df[
    (part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') &
    (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')
]

# Calculate the average quantity for the filtered parts
average_quantity = filtered_parts_df['P_QUANTITY'].mean()

# Calculate the average yearly gross loss in revenue
brand_23_med_bag_df['Potential_Loss'] = brand_23_med_bag_df.apply(
    lambda row: row['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] if row['L_QUANTITY'] < (0.2 * average_quantity) else 0, axis=1)
average_yearly_loss = brand_23_med_bag_df['Potential_Loss'].sum() / 7  # Assume 7 years

# Store the result
result = pd.DataFrame([{'Average_Yearly_Loss': average_yearly_loss}])
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now for the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Install MongoDB driver
pip install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip install pandas

# Install direct_redis
pip install direct_redis
```

Please save the Python script with a `.py` extension and the Bash script with a `.sh` extension. Make sure to give execute permissions to the bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` command before running it.
