The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results).

response, Here's the requested Python code (`query_code.py`):

```python

df_mysql = pd.read_sql(query_mysql, conn_mysql)

client_mongo = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)

```

Here's the requested bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`), which is used to install all dependencies to run the Python code above:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql, pymongo, pandas and direct_redis using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Please run the bash script with root privileges to ensure that the dependencies are installed system-wide. Also note that the script assumes that the `apt` package manager is available, which is typical for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. If you are using a different Linux distribution with another package manager (e.g., `yum` or `dnf`), you'll need to adjust the installation commands accordingly. Furthermore, the actual execution of MongoDB and Redis queries would need to be adapted based on your database schema and your specific needs, as the provided Python code assumes common structures.
