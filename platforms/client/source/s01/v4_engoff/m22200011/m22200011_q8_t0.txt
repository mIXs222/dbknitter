Next, here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```sh
# File: install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql to connect to MySQL server
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pymongo to connect to MongoDB server
pip3 install pymongo

# Install direct_redis to connect to Redis server
pip3 install direct_redis

# Install pandas for data handling
pip3 install pandas
```

Note: To make the bash script executable, run `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`. Moreover, the provided Python script makes assumptions about the data model for MongoDB and Redis due to the lack of concrete details, especially the structure of embedded documents for MongoDB and the storage method for Redis. This may require fine-tuning with actual details of the implementation.
