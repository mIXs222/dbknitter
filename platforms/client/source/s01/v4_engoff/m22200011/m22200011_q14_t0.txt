The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the python code that you can use to execute the query on your original data:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pymongo
from bson.json_util import dumps
import json
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
from datetime import datetime

# MongoDB connection
mongoclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = mongoclient["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongodb["lineitem"]

# Retrieve lineitem data from MongoDB
query = {
    "L_SHIPDATE": {
        "$gte": datetime(1995, 9, 1),
        "$lt": datetime(1995, 10, 1)
    }
}
lineitem_cursor = lineitem_collection.find(query)
lineitem_list = list(lineitem_cursor)
lineitems = pd.DataFrame(lineitem_list)

# Calculate revenue
lineitems['revenue'] = lineitems['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitems['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Redis connection
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve part data from Redis
part_keys = r.keys('part:*')
part_data = []
for key in part_keys:
    part_data.append(json.loads(r.get(key)))

# Convert to DataFrame
parts = pd.DataFrame(part_data)

# Find promotional parts
promotional_parts = parts['P_CONTAINER'].str.contains('PROMO')

# Filter lineitems for promotional parts
promo_lineitems = lineitems[lineitems['L_PARTKEY'].isin(promotional_parts.index)]

# Calculate total and promotional revenue
total_revenue = lineitems['revenue'].sum()
promo_revenue = promo_lineitems['revenue'].sum()

# Calculate promotion effect percentage
promotion_effect = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100

# Output result to CSV
output = pd.DataFrame([{'Promotion Effect (%)': promotion_effect}])
output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script you can use to create the environment and install all the dependencies in order to run the python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip to the latest version
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the dependencies
pip install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis

# Run the python script provided
python3 run_query.py
```
