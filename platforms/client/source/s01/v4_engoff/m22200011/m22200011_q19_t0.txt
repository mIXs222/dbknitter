The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results).

response, Here's the Python code that you can save as `query_code.py`:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Constants:
mongodb_host = "mongodb"
mongodb_port = 27017
redis_host = "redis"
redis_port = 6379
mongodb_db_name = "tpch"
redis_db_name = 0

# MongoDB Connection:
mongo_client = MongoClient(host=mongodb_host, port=mongodb_port)
mongodb = mongo_client[mongodb_db_name]

# Redis Connection:
redis_client = DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=redis_db_name)

# Load MongoDB data:
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.lineitem.find()))

# Load Redis data:
part_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(redis_client.get('part')))

# Part selection based on criteria:
brand_containers = {
    12: ['SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG'],
    23: ['MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK'],
    34: ['LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG']
}

size_ranges = {
    12: (1, 5),
    23: (1, 10),
    34: (1, 15)
}

quantity_ranges = {
    12: (1, 11),
    23: (10, 20),
    34: (20, 30)
}

# Filter parts
filtered_parts = part_df[part_df.apply(
    lambda row: row['P_CONTAINER'] in brand_containers.get(row['P_BRAND'], []) and
                size_ranges[row['P_BRAND']][0] <= row['P_SIZE'] <= size_ranges[row['P_BRAND']][1],
    axis=1
)]

# Map Part Keys to Brands for Filtering Lineitems
part_key_to_brand = filtered_parts.set_index('P_PARTKEY')['P_BRAND'].to_dict()

# Filter Lineitems
filtered_lineitems = lineitem[lineitem.apply(
    lambda row: row['L_PARTKEY'] in part_key_to_brand and
                quantity_ranges[part_key_to_brand[row['L_PARTKEY']]][0] <= row['L_QUANTITY'] <= quantity_ranges[part_key_to_brand[row['L_PARTKEY']]][1] and
                row['L_SHIPMODE'] in ['AIR', 'AIR REG'],
    axis=1
)]

# Calculate Gross Discounted Revenue
filtered_lineitems['REVENUE'] = filtered_lineitems.apply(
    lambda row: (row['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - row['L_DISCOUNT'])),
    axis=1
)

# Save query's results to CSV
filtered_lineitems.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

For the Bash script to install the dependencies, save this as `install_dependencies.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymongo redis direct-redis

# Ensure the script has execute permissions
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Please ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and environment to run these scripts and that MongoDB and Redis are properly configured to allow connections from your script execution environment.
