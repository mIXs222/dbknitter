The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode which is MAIL and SHIP, for lineitems actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query_code.py`) to execute the query on your original data:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connection info for MySQL
mysql_connection_info = {
    'database': 'tpch',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'host': 'mysql'
}

# Connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_connection_info)
cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Fetch orders data from MySQL
sql = """
SELECT O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERPRIORITY
FROM orders
WHERE O_ORDERPRIORITY = 'URGENT' OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = 'HIGH'
"""
cursor.execute(sql)
orders_data = cursor.fetchall()
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY'])
cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Connection info for Redis
redis_connection_info = {
    'host': 'redis',
    'port': 6379,
    'db': 0
}

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(**redis_connection_info)

# Fetch lineitem data from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Filter lineitem data
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) &
    (lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= pd.Timestamp('1994-01-01')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] <= pd.Timestamp('1995-01-01')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE']) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
]

# Merge the filtered data
merged_df = pd.merge(
    filtered_lineitem_df,
    orders_df,
    how='inner',
    left_on='L_ORDERKEY',
    right_on='O_ORDERKEY'
)

# Get the count of late lineitems by SHIPMODE and ORDERPRIORITY
result_df = merged_df.groupby(['L_SHIPMODE', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY']).size().reset_index(name='COUNT')

# Write result to file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install git+https://github.com/RedisGears/direct_redis.git
