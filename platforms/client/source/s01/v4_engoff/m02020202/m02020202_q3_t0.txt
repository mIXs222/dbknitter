Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the required query:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connect to mysql
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# Prepare mysql query
mysql_query = """
SELECT O_ORDERKEY, O_SHIPPRIORITY,
SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue
FROM orders, lineitem
WHERE O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'
AND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY O_ORDERKEY, O_SHIPPRIORITY
ORDER BY revenue DESC
"""
# Execute mysql query
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    mysql_orders_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Extract column names
order_column_names = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]

# Convert mysql data into DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(mysql_orders_data, columns=order_column_names)

# Close mysql connection
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get customer data from redis
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(redis_connection.get('customer')))

# Filter for market segment "BUILDING"
building_customers_df = customer_df[customer_df['C_MKTSEGMENT'] == 'BUILDING']

# Merge results based on customer keys
merged_df = pd.merge(orders_df, building_customers_df, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY', how='inner')

# Drop extra columns and sort by revenue
final_df = merged_df[['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'revenue']]
final_df = final_df.sort_values(by='revenue', ascending=False)

# Write to CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the corresponding bash script to install all dependencies:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# First, make sure pip is installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct-redis
