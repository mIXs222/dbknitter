Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code that integrates data from both MySQL and Redis to execute the described query:

```python
# File: execute_query.py

import pymysql
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Fetch orders placed in the last 7 years from MySQL
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7 * 365)
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    query_orders = """
    SELECT O_CUSTKEY
    FROM orders
    WHERE O_ORDERDATE >= %s
    """
    cursor.execute(query_orders, (seven_years_ago,))
    active_customers = set(ck[0] for ck in cursor.fetchall())

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch customer data from Redis
customer_data = pd.read_msgpack(redis_connection.get('customer'))

mysql_conn.close()

# Filter customers with specific country codes and positive account balances
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
filtered_customers = customer_data[
    (customer_data['C_PHONE'].str[:2].isin(country_codes)) &
    (customer_data['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.0) &
    (~customer_data['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(active_customers))
]

# Calculate counts and average balances by country code
result = (
    filtered_customers
    .groupby(customer_data['C_PHONE'].str[:2].rename('COUNTRY_CODE'))
    .agg(CUSTOMER_COUNT=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'), AVERAGE_BALANCE=('C_ACCTBAL', 'mean'))
    .reset_index()
)

# Write result to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run that Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: install_dependencies.sh

# Installing pip for Python package management
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Installing pymysql and direct_redis
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install direct_redis

# Installing pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

Please, make sure that both files are executable and run the bash script before executing the python script.
