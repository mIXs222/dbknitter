It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Here's the Bash script in a file named `setup.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Upgrade packages
apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install direct-redis
```

Make sure you execute the bash script with sufficient permissions, and you might need to ensure it is set as executable with the command `chmod +x setup.sh`. Please also note that running the `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade` commands without specifying packages might upgrade all the system packages which could have side effects depending on your system configuration and installed packages.
