Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level., The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the customers who have ever placed quantity orders larger than 300.

Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that would achieve the task described:

```python
# Save this code in a file named `execute_query.py`
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

def get_mysql_orders_data():
    connection = pymysql.connect(
        host='mysql', database='tpch',
        user='root', password='my-secret-pw'
    )
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(
                "SELECT O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_TOTALPRICE "
                "FROM orders WHERE O_TOTALPRICE > 300"
            )
            orders_data = cursor.fetchall()
    finally:
        connection.close()
    return orders_data

def get_redis_customers_data():
    redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    customers_data = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('customer'))
    return customers_data

def main():
    orders_data = get_mysql_orders_data()
    customers_data = get_redis_customers_data()

    orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE'])

    merged_data = pd.merge(customers_data, orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
    result = merged_data[['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE']]

    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And here is the bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
# Save this code in a file named `setup.sh`
#!/bin/bash

# Make sure pip is installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pandas
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# Since "direct_redis" is not a standard library, this might require additional steps or might be pseudocode.
# If "direct_redis" is not available, this would be the place to clone the repository and manually install it.
# Assuming it's a custom library and can be accessed or installed directly:
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Make sure to grant execution permissions to the setup script by running `chmod +x setup.sh` before executing it.
