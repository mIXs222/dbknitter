The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query across the different data platforms:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_query = """
    SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_RETAILPRICE FROM part
"""
part_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_con = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_str = redis_con.get('lineitem')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(lineitem_str)

# Filter lineitems by date
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])
lineitem_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= pd.Timestamp('1995-09-01')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= pd.Timestamp('1995-10-01'))
]

# Compute Revenue
lineitem_df['revenue'] = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Merge DataFrames on part keys
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate total revenue and revenue from promotional parts
total_revenue = merged_df['revenue'].sum()

# Assuming "promotional parts" is a characteristic encoded in P_COMMENT
# This may vary and might require an actual flag or additional information
# to accurately determine whether a part is promotional
is_promotion = merged_df['P_COMMENT'].str.contains('promo', case=False, na=False)
promo_revenue = merged_df[is_promotion]['revenue'].sum()

# Calculate percentage
promo_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Write to CSV file
with open("query_output.csv", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"Promotion Effect, {promo_percentage}")

print("Query executed and saved to query_output.csv.")
```

Next, here is the bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```sh
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python, pip and Redis
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip 
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis

# Note: Actual installation of Redis server is not required since we are connecting to an external Redis host
# The 'direct_redis' library will handle the connection to the provided Redis server.
```

Make sure to grant execution permissions to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
