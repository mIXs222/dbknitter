The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue, customer key, customer name and customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems., \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the python code that you can save as `query.py`:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connection details
mysql_config = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch'
}

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_config)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Retrieving orders within the specified date range from MySQL
orders_query = """
SELECT O_CUSTKEY, SUM(O_TOTALPRICE*(1-L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue_lost
FROM orders
INNER JOIN lineitem ON O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
WHERE L_RETURNFLAG = 'R' AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1993-10-01' AND '1994-01-01'
GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY;
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(orders_query)
orders_result = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Create a dataframe from orders query result
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_result, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'revenue_lost'])

# Sort and prepare the data for merging
orders_df['C_CUSTKEY'] = orders_df['C_CUSTKEY'].astype(int)
orders_df.sort_values(by=['revenue_lost', 'C_CUSTKEY'], ascending=[False, True], inplace=True)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get customer data from Redis and convert to DataFrame
customer_data = redis.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_pickle(customer_data, compression=None)

# Merge orders_df with customer_df
merged_df = pd.merge(orders_df, customer_df, on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Sort the merged dataframe according to the specified conditions, dropping duplicated customer keys while keeping the first entry
final_df = merged_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['C_CUSTKEY']).sort_values(by=['revenue_lost', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'C_ACCTBAL'], ascending=[False, True, False])

# Save to CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies, which you can name `install_dependencies.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Updating repositories and installing Python and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis
```

Ensure that this bash script has executable permissions:

```sh
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
