Here is the Bash script for your `.sh` file (let's name it `install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade existing packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pandas through pip
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# Assuming 'direct_redis' is available on PyPi. If it's not, this command needs to be adjusted.
pip3 install direct_redis

# You are now ready to run the Python script
# python3 execute_query.py
```

Please note that Redis typically doesn't support SQL-like joins or complex queries directly, so you would normally store pre-computed, denormalized data or use a secondary process to compute and store the required data. In this case, the Redis portion of the code assumes that the `DirectRedis.get` method retrieves a pandas DataFrame which can be manipulated with pandas functions. This is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual method used to retrieve and prepare data from Redis.
