This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query.py`) to execute the described query:

```python
import pymysql
import csv
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get orders data from MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT O_CUSTKEY, O_COMMENT FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS NOT LIKE 'pending%' AND O_ORDERSTATUS NOT LIKE 'deposits%'")
    orders_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert orders data to Pandas DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'O_COMMENT'])

# Get customer data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('customer'), orient='records')

# Group by customer key and count non-special categories in comment
orders_grouped = orders_df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY').agg({'O_COMMENT': lambda x: x[~x.str.contains('pending|deposits')].count()}).reset_index()
orders_grouped.columns = ['C_CUSTKEY', 'NUM_ORDERS']

# Merge customer data with orders data
result = customer_df.merge(orders_grouped, how='left', on='C_CUSTKEY')
result.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Count the distribution
distribution = result.groupby('NUM_ORDERS').size().reset_index(name='NUM_CUSTOMERS')

# Write the output to a CSV file
distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
redis_conn.close()
```

And here's the Bash script (`setup.sh`) to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
