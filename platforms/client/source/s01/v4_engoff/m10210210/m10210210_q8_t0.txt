response, Below is the Python code that you can use to execute the described query (`query.py`):

```python

mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',

    database='tpch'
)

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Redis connection
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

def get_data_from_redis(table_name):
    df_json = redis_conn.get(table_name)
    return pd.read_json(df_json)

def execute_mysql_query(query):
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(query)
        return cursor.fetchall()

```

And here's the corresponding Bash script to install all the dependencies, which you can save as `setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set up a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required python packages
pip install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis

# Run the Python script
python query.py
