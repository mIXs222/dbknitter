The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode which is MAIL and SHIP, for lineitems actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code:

```python
# Import required packages
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongodb['orders']

# Prepare the queries
mysql_query = """
SELECT L_SHIPMODE, COUNT(*) as late_lineitems_count, L_ORDERKEY
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE
AND L_RECEIPTDATE > L_COMMITDATE
AND L_RECEIPTDATE BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1995-01-01'
AND (L_SHIPMODE = 'MAIL' OR L_SHIPMODE = 'SHIP')
GROUP BY L_SHIPMODE, L_ORDERKEY
"""

# Execute the MySQL query
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    mysql_results = cursor.fetchall()

# Fetch the order priorities from MongoDB
mongo_results = list(orders_collection.find(
    {
        "O_ORDERKEY": {"$in": [row[2] for row in mysql_results]},
    },
    {
        "O_ORDERKEY": 1, "O_ORDERPRIORITY": 1
    }
))

# Classify the shipping priorities
urgency_map = {}
for order in mongo_results:
    urgency_map[order['O_ORDERKEY']] = "URGENT_OR_HIGH" if order['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] in ['URGENT', 'HIGH'] else "OTHER"

# Combine the results from both databases

    final_results.append((shipmode, order_priority_group, late_lineitems_count))

# Sort the results

with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    for line in final_results:

```

And here is the Bash script for dependencies installation:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
pip install pymongo
