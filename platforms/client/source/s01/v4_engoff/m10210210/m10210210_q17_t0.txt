What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results).

response, Here's the Python code (query_script.py) that satisfies the requirements:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                                   user='root',
                                   password='my-secret-pw',
                                   database='tpch')

# Query MySQL
query_lineitem = """
SELECT
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_QUANTITY
FROM
    lineitem
"""
lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(query_lineitem, mysql_connection)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get part DataFrame from Redis
part_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('part'))

# Filter part DataFrame for brand "Brand#23" and container "MED BAG"
filtered_parts = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Join DataFrames on partkey
joined_df = lineitem_df.merge(filtered_parts, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the average quantity of the filtered parts
average_quantity = joined_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()

# Calculate average yearly gross loss revenue if orders less than 20% of the average quantity were not taken
threshold_quantity = 0.2 * average_quantity
potential_loss_df = joined_df[joined_df['L_QUANTITY'] < threshold_quantity]
potential_loss_df['YEARLY_LOSS'] = potential_loss_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE']

# Calculate the average yearly revenue loss
average_loss = potential_loss_df['YEARLY_LOSS'].sum() / 7

# Write the result to a CSV file
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'Average_Yearly_Revenue_Loss': [average_loss]})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And for the bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package listings
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and PIP
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python packages (pymysql, pandas, direct_redis)
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis
