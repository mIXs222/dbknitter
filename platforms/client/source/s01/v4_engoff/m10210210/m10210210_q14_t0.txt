The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
# Create a cursor
cursor = mysql_connection.cursor()
# Query to select relevant data from the lineitem table in the MySQL database
query_mysql = """
SELECT
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-09-01' AND '1995-10-01';
"""
cursor.execute(query_mysql)
# Fetch the data into pandas DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['L_PARTKEY', 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'L_DISCOUNT'])
# Close the connection to the MySQL database
cursor.close()
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to the Redis database
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
# Get the 'part' data from Redis and convert it to a pandas DataFrame
part_data = eval(redis_client.get('part'))
part_df = pd.DataFrame(part_data)

# Merging DataFrames on L_PARTKEY to only keep promotional parts, assuming that promotional parts are flagged in the `part` DataFrame
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the revenue for each line item
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

```

And here's the bash script to install dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package list
apt-get update -y

# Install Python and Pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct-redis
