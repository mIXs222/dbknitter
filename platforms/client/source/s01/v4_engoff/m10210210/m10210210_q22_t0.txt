This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code you requested, which you can save with a `.py` file extension, for example, `execute_query.py`:

```python
# execute_query.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongodb['orders']

# Query MongoDB for orders older than 7 years
seven_years_ago = datetime.now().year - 7
orders_query = {
    'O_ORDERDATE': {'$lt': datetime(seven_years_ago, 1, 1)}
}
orders_data = list(orders_collection.find(orders_query, {'_id': 0, 'O_CUSTKEY': 1}))
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data)

# Connect to Redis
import direct_redis
redis = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get customer data from Redis and load it into a dataframe
customer_data = redis.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_json(customer_data)

# Filter customers based on country codes and account balance
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
customer_df = customer_df[(customer_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2].isin(country_codes)) & (customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0)]

# Find customers who have not placed orders for 7 years
result_df = customer_df[~customer_df['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'])]
# Aggregate result to get count and average balance
summary_df = result_df.groupby(customer_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2]) \
    .agg(Count=('C_CUSTKEY', 'size'), Average_Balance=('C_ACCTBAL', 'mean')) \
    .reset_index()

# Write results to CSV
summary_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
```

Here is the bash script you requested to install all dependencies, which you can save with a `.sh` file extension, for example, `setup_dependencies.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup_dependencies.sh

# Install Python MongoDB driver (pymongo)
pip install pymongo

# Install pandas, required for DataFrame operations
pip install pandas

# Install direct_redis for connecting to Redis and its dependencies
pip install jsonpickle
pip install direct_redis
```

Make sure the bash script is executable by running `chmod +x setup_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
