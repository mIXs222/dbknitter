The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here's the requested Python code to execute the cross-platform query:

```python
# python_code.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL connection and query execution
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT
            s.N_NAME,
            YEAR(l.L_SHIPDATE) AS year,
            SUM((l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) - (ps.PS_SUPPLYCOST * l.L_QUANTITY)) AS profit
        FROM 
            lineitem l
        JOIN
            partsupp ps ON l.L_PARTKEY = ps.PS_PARTKEY AND l.L_SUPPKEY = ps.PS_SUPPKEY
        JOIN
            supplier s ON l.L_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
        WHERE
            l.L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1992-01-01' AND '1997-12-31'
        GROUP BY
            s.N_NAME, year
        ORDER BY
            s.N_NAME ASC, year DESC
    """)
    mysql_data = cursor.fetchall()
    mysql_columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]

# MongoDB connection and retrieval of 'nation' and 'supplier' tables
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
nation_collection = mongo_db["nation"]
supplier_collection = mongo_db["supplier"]
nations = pd.DataFrame(list(nation_collection.find()), columns=['N_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME', 'N_REGIONKEY', 'N_COMMENT'])
suppliers = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier_collection.find()), columns=['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_NATIONKEY', 'S_PHONE', 'S_ACCTBAL', 'S_COMMENT'])

# Redis connection and retrieval of 'part' table
redis_client = DirectRedis(port=6379, host='redis')
part = pd.DataFrame(redis_client.get("part"))

# Combining the MySQL and MongoDB data
mysql_df = pd.DataFrame(mysql_data, columns=mysql_columns)
combined_df = pd.merge(mysql_df, suppliers, left_on="L_SUPPKEY", right_on="S_SUPPKEY", how="left")
combined_df = pd.merge(combined_df, nations, left_on="S_NATIONKEY", right_on="N_NATIONKEY", how="left")

# Output to query_output.csv
combined_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next, here's the requested Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and install Python 3 pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install pandas

# Install the direct_redis package (assuming it is available for installation)
pip3 install direct-redis
```

Please note that the given Python script assumes that the `supplier` table is accessible through a MySQL database, which is not explicitly stated in your provided information. If the `supplier` table is only available in MongoDB, the script would need to be adapted to join the data from MongoDB rather than MySQL. Also, `direct_redis` and the function `DirectRedis` might not exist as standard packages or functions and seem to be referring to a custom library or codebase. Adjustments to the Redis section might be necessary to reflect the actual package and functions available in your environment.
