This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code `execute_query.py`:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import csv
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetching orders data from MongoDB
mongo_orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_orders_collection.find({}, {
    "_id": 0, "O_ORDERKEY": 1, "O_CUSTKEY": 1, "O_ORDERSTATUS": 1, "O_COMMENT": 1
})))

# Filter out 'pending' or 'deposits' from order comments and exclude pending order statuses
filtered_orders = mongo_orders_df[~mongo_orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains("pending|deposits", case=False, na=False)]
filtered_orders = filtered_orders[~filtered_orders['O_ORDERSTATUS'].str.contains("P")]

# Fetching customer data from Redis
customer_keys = redis_client.keys('customer:*')
customer_data = [eval(redis_client.get(key)) for key in customer_keys]
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(customer_data)

# Renaming Redis keys to match with MongoDB data keys
customer_df.rename(columns={

# Counting orders by customer
orders_count_by_customer = filtered_orders.groupby('O_CUSTKEY').size().reset_index(name='order_count')

# Merging customers with orders count
customer_orders = pd.merge(customer_df, orders_count_by_customer, on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left')

# Filling 0 where there are no orders
