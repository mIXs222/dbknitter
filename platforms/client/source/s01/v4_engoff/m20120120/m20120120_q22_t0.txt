This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# MongoDB connection & query
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']

customer_data = list(db.customer.find(
    {"$and": [
        {"C_PHONE": {"$regex": "^(20|40|22|30|39|42|21)"}},
        {"C_ACCTBAL": {"$gt": 0.0}}
    ]},
    {"C_CUSTKEY": 1, "_id": 0, "C_PHONE": 1, "C_ACCTBAL": 1}
))
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(customer_data)
# Extract the country code
customer_df['country_code'] = customer_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2]

# Redis connection & query
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders_df = pd.read_json(r.get('orders').decode('utf-8'))
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])

# Filter orders that are at least 7 years old and convert to DataFrame
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)
old_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] <= seven_years_ago]

# Merge dataframes and perform the aggregation
merged_df = customer_df.merge(old_orders_df, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
result_df = merged_df.groupby('country_code').agg(
    customers_without_orders=('C_CUSTKEY', 'size'),
    avg_balance=('C_ACCTBAL', 'mean')
).reset_index()

# Save results to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure system is updated and install pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymongo direct-redis pandas
