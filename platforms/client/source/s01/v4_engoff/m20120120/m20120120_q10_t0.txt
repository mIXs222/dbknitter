The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue, customer key, customer name and customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems., \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Now, the Bash script to install all the required dependencies for running the above Python code can be as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the MySQL client and development libraries
sudo apt-get install -y default-libmysqlclient-dev

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Save the bash script as `install_dependencies.sh`, give it execution permissions using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`, and run it to install all dependencies.
