The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the query:

```python
# import required modules
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import pymongo
import redis
import csv
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_part = mongo_db['part']

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Define the valid sizes for parts
valid_sizes = [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]

# Query MySQL database to find suppliers who can supply parts that match the given criteria
mysql_query = """
SELECT PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY
FROM partsupp
WHERE PS_PARTKEY IN (SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part WHERE P_SIZE IN %s AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45' AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%%')
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query, (valid_sizes,))
partsupp_records = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Create a dataframe for partsupp
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(partsupp_records, columns=['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY'])

# Query MongoDB for parts that match the given criteria
mongo_results = mongo_part.find({
    'P_SIZE': {'$in': valid_sizes},
    'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'},
    'P_TYPE': {'$not': {'$regex': 'MEDIUM POLISHED'}},
})

# Create a dataframe for parts
part_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_results))

# Get supplier data from Redis
supplier_data = redis_client.get('supplier')
supplier_df = pd.read_csv(supplier_data.decode())

# Filter suppliers with complaints
complaints_df = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer')]
valid_suppliers = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_SUPPKEY'].isin(complaints_df['S_SUPPKEY'])]

# Merge the partsupp and part dataframes based on part key
merged_df = pd.merge(partsupp_df, part_df, left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Further merge with supplier dataframe to exclude suppliers with complaints
final_df = pd.merge(merged_df, valid_suppliers[['S_SUPPKEY']], left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Group by the required fields and get counts
analysis_df = final_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])['PS_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index()

# Sort the results according to the specified conditions
sorted_df = analysis_df.sort_values(by=['PS_SUPPKEY', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write the results to query_output.csv
sorted_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close all database connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies for the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Install the necessary packages for Debian/Ubuntu Linux

# Update system package list
sudo apt-get update

# Make sure pip is installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python package dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pandas pymongo redis direct-redis

# Note that the direct-redis package might need to be installed
# from a source code or specific repository if it is not available
# via pip. Include the installation method for direct-redis if necessary.
```

Please note that the instructions provided assume a Debian or Ubuntu-based system for the Bash script. Depending on your environment, and also the availability of 'direct_redis' which is not a standard library, modifications might be needed.
