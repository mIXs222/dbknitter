Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 with discounts between .06 - 0.01 and .06 + 0.01. The query lists the amount by which the total revenue would have increased if these discounts had been eliminated for lineitems with l_quantity less than 24. Note that the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code required to execute the query on the MySQL database, and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import csv

# MySQL connection parameters
db_params = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# SQL Query
sql_query = """
SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS potential_revenue_increase
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1995-01-01'
AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN 0.06 - 0.01 AND 0.06 + 0.01
AND L_QUANTITY < 24;
"""

# Connect to MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(**db_params)
try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        # Write the result to a CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
            csvwriter.writerow(['potential_revenue_increase'])
            csvwriter.writerow(result)
finally:
    connection.close()
```

Now for the required Bash script to install all dependencies to run the aforewritten Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql via pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Remember to grant executing permission to the bash script before running it and to execute the Python code within the environment where these dependencies are installed.
