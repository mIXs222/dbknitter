The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, First, let's create the Python code required to run the query:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# MongoDB Connection
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Check for promotional parts in MongoDB
promotional_parts = mongodb_db['part'].find({},
                                            {'P_PARTKEY': 1, '_id': 0})
promotional_partkeys = [pp['P_PARTKEY'] for pp in promotional_parts]

# Fetch lineitem data from MySQL and calculate revenue
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    query = """
    SELECT L_PARTKEY, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01' AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01' 
          AND L_PARTKEY IN ({})
    GROUP BY L_PARTKEY
    """.format(', '.join(['%s'] * len(promotional_partkeys)))
    
    cursor.execute(query, promotional_partkeys)
    result = cursor.fetchall()

# Calculating total revenue
total_revenue = sum(row[1] for row in result)

# Calculating promotional revenue
promotional_revenue = sum(row[1] for row in result if row[0] in promotional_partkeys)

# Calculating percentage
percentage = (promotional_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Write output to csv file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Promotional Revenue Percentage'])
    writer.writerow([percentage])

print("Query completed. Output written to query_output.csv.")

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

Now, let's create the bash script to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update repository and Install Python3 pip
apt-get update
apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql and pymongo
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to run the bash script with root privileges in order to install the packages system-wide. If you want to install the dependencies in a virtual environment, you must adjust the script accordingly.
