It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the required Python code:

```python
# python code (query.py)
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
part_collection = mongo_db["part"]
partsupp_collection = mongo_db["partsupp"]

# Query parts with the specified conditions from MongoDB
part_conditions = {
    "P_SIZE": {"$in": [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]},
    "P_TYPE": {"$ne": "MEDIUM POLISHED"},
    "P_BRAND": {"$ne": "Brand#45"}
}
part_fields = {
    "P_PARTKEY": 1,
    "_id": 0
}
part_docs = list(part_collection.find(part_conditions, part_fields))

# Convert MongoDB query results to DataFrame
part_df = pd.DataFrame(part_docs)

# Query partsupp to find matching suppliers for the parts from MongoDB
partsupp_fields = {
    "PS_PARTKEY": 1,
    "PS_SUPPKEY": 1,
    "_id": 0
}
partsupp_docs = list(partsupp_collection.find({"PS_PARTKEY": {"$in": part_df["P_PARTKEY"].tolist()}}, partsupp_fields))

# Convert MongoDB query results to DataFrame
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(partsupp_docs)

# Redis connection setup
redis_client = DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve supplier table from Redis
supplier_data = redis_client.get("supplier")
supplier_df = pd.read_json(supplier_data)

# Use the DataFrame query method to further filter suppliers
supplier_df = supplier_df.query("S_COMMENT.str.contains('Customer Complaints') == False", engine='python')

# Merge the DataFrames to find out how many suppliers can supply the parts
result_df = partsupp_df.merge(supplier_df, how='inner', left_on="PS_SUPPKEY", right_on="S_SUPPKEY")

# Group by S_SUPPKEY (supplier key) and count
final_df = result_df.groupby(['S_SUPPKEY']).size().reset_index(name='count')

# Sort the results as specified in the requirements
sorted_final_df = final_df.sort_values(by=['count', 'S_SUPPKEY'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write output to CSV file
sorted_final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script (setup.sh)

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip, if not already installed
apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct-redis
