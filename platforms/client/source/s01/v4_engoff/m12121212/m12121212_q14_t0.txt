The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

import pymongo
from bson.codec_options import CodecOptions
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
parts_collection = mongo_db['part']

# Retrieve all documents from the 'part' collection and convert to DataFrame
parts_data = list(parts_collection.find({}, projection={'_id': False}))
parts_df = pd.DataFrame(parts_data)

# Redis connection
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_data = redis_client.get('lineitem')
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(lineitem_data))

# Convert date strings to datetime objects for comparison
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])

# Define date range for the query
start_date = pd.Timestamp('1995-09-01')
end_date = pd.Timestamp('1995-10-01')

# Filter the lineitems based on date range and promotional parts
filtered_lineitems_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= end_date) &
    (lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(parts_df['P_PARTKEY']))
]

# Calculate revenue
filtered_lineitems_df['REVENUE'] = filtered_lineitems_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_lineitems_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Get sum of revenue for filtered data
total_revenue_from_promo = filtered_lineitems_df['REVENUE'].sum()

# Get total revenue from all parts shipped in date range
total_revenue = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= end_date)
]['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()

# Calculate percentage revenue from promo
percentage_revenue_from_promo = (total_revenue_from_promo / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Create result dataframe
result_df = pd.DataFrame([{"Percentage Revenue from Promo": percentage_revenue_from_promo}])

# Write output to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Part 2: Bash Script (`setup.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update system package manager
sudo apt update

# Python3 and pip installation
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo==3.12.3 pandas==1.3.4 direct_redis

# Note: direct_redis is a hypothetical package since there's no package with this exact name.
# If direct_redis refers to a custom or non-standard library, the installation step would need to be amended accordingly.
```

Please be aware that the hypothetical `direct_redis.DirectRedis` package is not a standard one, and you will need to replace the installation instruction with the actual command necessary for installing the library you are referring to. Additionally, since Redis normally does not store data in the tabular format expected by pandas, you might need to adjust the dataframe reading approach based on your actual data pipeline or serialization format.
