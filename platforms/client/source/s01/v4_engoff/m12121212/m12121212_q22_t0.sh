# Install direct_redis, which is not a standard package and may require additional steps if it exists
# For the sake of the example, we are assuming this is a valid package or a user-defined one that
# can be installed using pip. In case it's not, further steps might be needed.

# If 'direct_redis' is not a standard package, you could install it from a repository like this:
# pip3 install git+https://github.com/your-user/direct_redis.git

# Since direct_redis is a hypothetical module not available in standard repositories,
# The following line would normally fail since it's not a known package.
# For the purpose of this assignment, however, we are including it here.
pip3 install direct_redis
