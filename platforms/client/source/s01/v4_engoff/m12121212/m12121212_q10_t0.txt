The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue, customer key, customer name and customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems., \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results).

response, Here is the Python code (`query.py`) that will execute the query:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = client["tpch"]
collection_nation = mongodb["nation"]
collection_orders = mongodb["orders"]

# Redis connection
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from MongoDB
query_orders = {
    "O_ORDERDATE": {
        "$gte": datetime(1993, 10, 1),
        "$lt": datetime(1994, 1, 1)
    }
}
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(collection_orders.find(query_orders, projection={"_id": False})))

# Fetch data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('customer'), orient='records')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Filter relevant orders
orders_df = orders_df[orders_df["O_ORDERSTATUS"] == "R"]

# Compute lost revenue
lineitem_df["LOST_REVENUE"] = lineitem_df["L_EXTENDEDPRICE"] * (1 - lineitem_df["L_DISCOUNT"])

# Join customer with nation
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(list(collection_nation.find({}, projection={"_id": False})))
customer_with_nation = pd.merge(customer_df, nation_df, left_on="C_NATIONKEY", right_on="N_NATIONKEY")

# Join orders with lineitems and compute total lost revenue per customer
orders_with_lineitems = pd.merge(orders_df, lineitem_df, left_on="O_ORDERKEY", right_on="L_ORDERKEY")
total_lost_revenue = orders_with_lineitems.groupby("O_CUSTKEY")["LOST_REVENUE"].sum().reset_index()

# Join total lost revenue with customer information
result_df = pd.merge(total_lost_revenue, customer_with_nation, left_on="O_CUSTKEY", right_on="C_CUSTKEY")

# Select relevant columns and sort as per requirement
result_df = result_df[['C_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 'N_NAME', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'C_COMMENT', 'LOST_REVENUE']]
result_df.sort_values(by=['LOST_REVENUE', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ACCTBAL'], ascending=[False, True, True, True], inplace=True)

# Write to CSV
result_df.to_csv("query_output.csv", index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install the dependencies necessary to run the above Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis
