This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments., The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a brand 23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code saved with the name `query_execute.py`:

```python
# query_execute.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = client["tpch"]
part_collection = mongodb["part"]

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query MongoDB for parts with brand 'Brand#23' and container 'MED BAG'
part_query = {"P_BRAND": "Brand#23", "P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG"}
parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part_collection.find(part_query, {'_id': 0})))

# Query Redis for lineitems dataframe
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Merge MongoDB and Redis dataframes
merged_df = lineitem_df.merge(parts_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the average lineitem quantity
average_quantity = merged_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()

# Calculate the total revenue for lineitems where quantity is less than 20% of the average
small_quantity_revenue = merged_df.loc[merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] < average_quantity * 0.2, 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()

# Number of years in the database (7 years)
years_in_db = 7

# Calculate average yearly loss in revenue
average_yearly_loss = small_quantity_revenue / years_in_db

# Output the result to a CSV file
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'Average_Yearly_Loss': [average_yearly_loss]})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
