The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. The Python code (`query.py`):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Select orders from MongoDB within the date range
start_date = "1993-07-01"
end_date = "1993-10-01"
orders = orders_collection.find({
    "O_ORDERDATE": {"$gte": start_date, "$lt": end_date}
})
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders))

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(redis_client.get('lineitem')))

# Convert string dates to datetime objects for comparisons
lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'])

# Find lineitems where the receive date is after the commit date and get those orders' IDs
late_lineitems = lineitem_df[
    lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE']
]
late_order_keys = set(late_lineitems['L_ORDERKEY'])

# Filter orders_df for orders that contain late lineitems
late_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERKEY'].isin(late_order_keys)]

# Calculate the number of late orders for each order priority
order_priority_counts = late_orders_df.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY').size().reset_index(name='order_count')

# Sort by order priority
order_priority_counts_sorted = order_priority_counts.sort_values(by=['O_ORDERPRIORITY'])

# Convert the result to CSV and save it
order_priority_counts_sorted.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)
```

2. The Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MongoDB driver
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Here you would install the direct_redis package, however,
# direct_redis is not a standard package and cannot be located
# in public repositories, hence we assume it is provided otherwise.
# You should replace the line below with the correct installation
# method for direct_redis.

# pip3 install direct_redis

# Install CSV module (part of Python's standard library, so no action needed)
