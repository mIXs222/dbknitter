This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here's the Python code (`execute_query.py`) to execute the given query:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection and query
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Current date minus 7 years
cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)
match_stage = {
    "$match": {
        "O_ORDERDATE": {"$lte": cutoff_date},
        "O_TOTALPRICE": {"$gt": 0.00}
    }
}
group_stage = {
    "$group": {
        "_id": "$O_CUSTKEY",
        "avgTotalPrice": {"$avg": "$O_TOTALPRICE"}
    }
}
project_stage = {
    "$project": {
        "custkey": "$_id",
        "avgTotalPrice": 1,
        "_id": 0
    }
}

# Execute the aggregation pipeline
mongo_orders = list(orders_collection.aggregate([match_stage, group_stage, project_stage]))
mongo_custkeys = set([doc.get('custkey') for doc in mongo_orders])

# Redis connection and retrieval
redis_client = DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)
customer_data = redis_client.get('customer')
df_customer = pd.read_json(customer_data)

# Filter the dataframe for customers with specific country codes
country_codes = {'20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'}
df_customer['country_code'] = df_customer['C_PHONE'].str[:2]
df_customer = df_customer[df_customer['country_code'].isin(country_codes)]

# Exclude customers who have placed orders in the last 7 years
df_customer = df_customer[~df_customer['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(mongo_custkeys)]

# Filter customers with average account balance greater than 0
df_filtered = df_customer[df_customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.00]

# Group by the country code
result = df_filtered.groupby('country_code')['C_ACCTBAL'].agg(['count', 'mean']).reset_index()

# Rename columns and output to a CSV file
result.columns = ['Country Code', 'Customer Count', 'Average Account Balance']
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Here is the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install pip for Python3 if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis, which is not a standard package and may require additional steps if it exists
# For the sake of the example, we are assuming this is a valid package or a user-defined one that
# can be installed using pip. In case it's not, further steps might be needed.

# If 'direct_redis' is not a standard package, you could install it from a repository like this:
# pip3 install git+https://github.com/your-user/direct_redis.git

# Since direct_redis is a hypothetical module not available in standard repositories,
# The following line would normally fail since it's not a known package.
# For the purpose of this assignment, however, we are including it here.
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please replace `'your-user'` with the appropriate username and correct path to your repository if `direct_redis` is a custom module. If `direct_redis` is proprietary or not publicly available, you would have to install it from a private repository or source, which must be provided by you.

Note: The code above assumes that the DirectRedis class you've mentioned can convert a key to a pandas DataFrame directly. Since this class is not a standard Python/Redis module and seems to be application-specific, you will need to adapt this part of the code based on how the `DirectRedis` class is actually implemented.
