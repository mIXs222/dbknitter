The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue, customer key, customer name and customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems., \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the desired query on your MongoDB database:

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update and install Python3 and pip3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo Python package
pip3 install pymongo
