message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use \'pymongo\' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient(host=host, port=port)

# Execute the aggregation pipeline
results = list(db.customer.aggregate(pipeline))

# Write results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Number of Orders', 'Customer Count'])

    for result in results:
        writer.writerow([result['_id'], result['customer_count']])
```

2. Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:
```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip3
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo
