Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level., The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the customers who have ever placed quantity orders larger than 300. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Here is the requested Bash script (`.sh`) file content for installing dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup.sh

# Update and Install Python3 and Pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo
```

Please save each content as a separate file (first block as `large_volume_customer_query.py`, and the second block as `setup.sh` respectively), and execute them on your local environment as needed.
