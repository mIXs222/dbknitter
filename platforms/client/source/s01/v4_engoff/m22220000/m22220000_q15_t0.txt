The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped between 1996-01-01 and 1996-04-01. In case of a tie, the query lists all suppliers whose contribution was equal to the maximum, presented in supplier number order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (query_code.py):

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Fetch lineitem data from MySQL between the specified dates
query_mysql = """
    SELECT L_SUPPKEY, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1996-01-01' AND '1996-04-01'
    GROUP BY L_SUPPKEY
"""

lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(query_mysql, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch supplier data from Redis
supplier_json = redis_client.get('supplier')
supplier_df = pd.read_json(supplier_json, orient='records')

# Merge MySQL and Redis data
merged_df = pd.merge(supplier_df, lineitem_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='L_SUPPKEY')

# Get the maximum total revenue
max_revenue = merged_df['total_revenue'].max()

# Find the supplier with the maximum revenue
top_suppliers_df = merged_df[merged_df['total_revenue'] == max_revenue]

# Sort by supplier key - S_SUPPKEY (asc)
top_suppliers_sorted_df = top_suppliers_df.sort_values(by=['S_SUPPKEY'])

# Write result to CSV
top_suppliers_sorted_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script for the dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip if it's not already installed
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
```

After running the bash script to ensure the necessary packages are installed, execute the Python script to perform the required action and generate the CSV file.
