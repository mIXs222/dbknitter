message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmysql has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mysql:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with mysql, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- username: root\n- password: my-secret-pw\n- hostname: mysql\n- instruction: Use the python library \'pymysql\' to connect the mysql server. Do NOT use \'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor\'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is your requested Python code and the corresponding bash script.

Python Code (`query_execution.py`):
```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # SQL query for the customer and orders relationship
        sql = """
        SELECT c.C_CUSTKEY, COUNT(o.O_ORDERKEY) as num_orders
        FROM customer c
        LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY AND o.O_ORDERSTATUS NOT IN ('pending', 'deposits')
        GROUP BY c.C_CUSTKEY;
        """
        cursor.execute(sql)

        # Fetch all the records and write them to a CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
            csvwriter.writerow(['C_CUSTKEY', 'NUM_ORDERS'])

            for row in cursor.fetchall():
                csvwriter.writerow(row)

finally:
    connection.close()
