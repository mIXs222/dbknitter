Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase. This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on your MySQL database:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# MySQL connection details
MYSQL_HOST = 'mysql'
MYSQL_DB = 'tpch'
MYSQL_USER = 'root'
MYSQL_PASS = 'my-secret-pw'

# Connect to MySQL
connection = pymysql.connect(host=MYSQL_HOST,
                             user=MYSQL_USER,
                             password=MYSQL_PASS,
                             db=MYSQL_DB)

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        
        # Construct the SQL Query
        sql = """
        SELECT 
            SUBSTRING(C_PHONE, 1, 2) AS country_code,
            COUNT(*) AS num_customers,
            AVG(C_ACCTBAL) AS avg_balance
        FROM 
            customer as c
        WHERE 
            C_ACCTBAL > 0.00 AND
            SUBSTRING(C_PHONE, 1, 2) IN ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21') AND
            NOT EXISTS (
                SELECT *
                FROM orders AS o
                WHERE o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY AND 
                      o.O_ORDERDATE >= %s
            )
        GROUP BY 
            country_code
        """
        
        # Calculate the date 7 years ago from today
        seven_years_ago = datetime.today() - timedelta(days=7*365)
        
        # Execute SQL Query
        cursor.execute(sql, (seven_years_ago,))
        
        # Fetch the result
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        
        # Write result to CSV
        with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
            writer.writerow(['country_code', 'num_customers', 'avg_balance'])
            for row in result:
                writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    connection.close()
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the pymysql library
pip3 install pymysql
```

Please make sure that you have appropriate privileges to execute these scripts and install packages on the system where you intend to run them.
