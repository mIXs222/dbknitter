The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.
