The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped between 1996-01-01 and 1996-04-01. In case of a tie, the query lists all suppliers whose contribution was equal to the maximum, presented in supplier number order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the given query:

```python
# top_supplier.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
supplier_collection = mongodb['supplier']

# Query to select all suppliers in MySQL
mysql_query = """
    SELECT L_SUPPKEY, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue

    GROUP BY L_SUPPKEY
"""

top_revenue = 0
top_suppliers = []

with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    for row in cursor:
        supplier_revenue = row[1]
        if supplier_revenue > top_revenue:
            top_revenue = supplier_revenue
            top_suppliers = [row[0]]
        elif supplier_revenue == top_revenue:

# Query MongoDB for the top supplier details
top_suppliers_info = list(supplier_collection.find({'S_SUPPKEY': {'$in': top_suppliers}}, {'_id': 0}))

# Sorting suppliers
top_suppliers_sorted = sorted(top_suppliers_info, key=lambda x: x['S_SUPPKEY'])

# Write to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()

```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip and Python development files (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install Python library dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
