message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmysql has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mysql:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mysql, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- username: root\n- password: my-secret-pw\n- hostname: mysql\n- instruction: Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date of 1995-03-15 and where market segment is BUILDING. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`execute_query.py`) that you requested:

```python

    'user': 'root',

# Function to connect to the MySQL database and execute the query

    try:
        # Open the connection to the database
        connection = pymysql.connect(**conn_details)

execute_query_and_save_to_csv(sql_query, mysql_conn_details, 'query_output.csv')
```

And here is your Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Update package lists
echo "Updating package lists..."
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
echo "Installing Python3 and pip..."
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python library 'pymysql'
echo "Installing pymysql..."
pip3 install pymysql

echo "All dependencies are installed."
```

Make sure you give execution permissions to the bash script by running:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
And then you can run the bash script using:
```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```
