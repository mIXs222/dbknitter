response, Here is a Python code that will execute the described operations:

```python
# python_code.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mycursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to the MongoDB database
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
parts_collection = mongo_db["part"]

# Find the average quantity for parts with P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' and P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'
brand_parts = parts_collection.find({"P_BRAND": "Brand#23", "P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG"})
part_keys = [p["P_PARTKEY"] for p in brand_parts]

    avg_yearly_loss_result = mycursor.fetchone()
    avg_yearly_loss = avg_yearly_loss_result[0] if avg_yearly_loss_result else 0
else:
    avg_yearly_loss = 0

# Disconnect from the MySQL database
mysql_conn.close()

# Write to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['avg_yearly_loss'])
    writer.writerow([avg_yearly_loss])

print(f"The output has been written to query_output.csv with an average yearly loss of: {avg_yearly_loss}")
```

Additionally, here's the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to give the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) execution permissions by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it. Run it using the `./install_dependencies.sh` command to install the dependencies on a UNIX-like system.
