Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 with discounts between .06 - 0.01 and .06 + 0.01. The query lists the amount by which the total revenue would have increased if these discounts had been eliminated for lineitems with l_quantity less than 24. Note that the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# MySQL connection details
mysql_conn_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_info)
try:
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Write the SQL query
        sql = '''

        cursor.execute(sql)
        
        # Fetch the result
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        revenue_change = result[0] if result[0] is not None else 0
finally:
    mysql_conn.close()

# Write output to csv
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['revenue_change']) # header row
    writer.writerow([revenue_change])
```

### Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql library
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to give the bash script execution permissions before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
Then execute the script to install necessary dependencies.
