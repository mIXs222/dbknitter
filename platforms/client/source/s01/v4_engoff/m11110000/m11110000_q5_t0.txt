The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in ASIA. The query considers only parts ordered between 1990-01-01 and 1995-01-01. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. The Python code (.py) to execute the query across different databases:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get ASIA nations from MongoDB
asia_nations = list(mongo_db.nation.find({
    'N_REGIONKEY': {'$in': [r['R_REGIONKEY'] for r in mongo_db.region.find({'R_NAME': 'ASIA'})]}
}, {'_id': 0, 'N_NATIONKEY': 1}))

asia_nation_keys = [n['N_NATIONKEY'] for n in asia_nations]

# Prepare query for MySQL
query = """

"""

# Since we cannot bind a list of integers as a parameter, we're preparing the IN clause manually
in_clause = ', '.join(['%s'] * len(asia_nation_keys))
formatted_query = query % (in_clause, in_clause)
params = asia_nation_keys * 2

# Execute query on MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(formatted_query, params)
    results = cursor.fetchall()

# Write the query results to the file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)
    
    # Write the headers
    csv_writer.writerow(['nation_name', 'revenue_volume'])
    
    for row in results:
        csv_writer.writerow(row)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

2. The Bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script installs all dependencies needed to run the Python code

# Update package manager and install Python 3 and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL and PyMongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to grant execute permission to your bash script file using `chmod +x script.sh` before running it.
