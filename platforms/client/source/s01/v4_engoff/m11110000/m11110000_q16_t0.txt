It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
