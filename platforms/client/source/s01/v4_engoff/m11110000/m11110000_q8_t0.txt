response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the query on your original data:

mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Save the Python code to a file named `query_execute.py` and the Bash script to a file named `install_dependencies.sh`. Make sure to give execute permissions to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`.
