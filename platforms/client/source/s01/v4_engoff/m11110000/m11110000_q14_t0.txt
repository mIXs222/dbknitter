The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code that accomplishes the task:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Constants for the MySQL Connection
MYSQL_HOST = 'mysql'
MYSQL_DB = 'tpch'
MYSQL_USER = 'root'
MYSQL_PASSWORD = 'my-secret-pw'

# Constants for the MongoDB Connection
MONGO_HOST = 'mongodb'
MONGO_PORT = 27017
MONGO_DB = 'tpch'

# Establish connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host=MYSQL_HOST, user=MYSQL_USER, password=MYSQL_PASSWORD, db=MYSQL_DB)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Establish connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(host=MONGO_HOST, port=MONGO_PORT)
mongo_db = mongo_client[MONGO_DB]

# MongoDB query for fetching promotional parts
promotional_parts = mongo_db.part.find({
    "$expr": {
        "$lte": [{"$dateFromString": {"dateString": "$P_RETAILPRICE.promo_start_date"}},
                 datetime(1995, 9, 1)],
        "$gte": [{"$dateFromString": {"dateString": "$P_RETAILPRICE.promo_end_date"}},
                 datetime(1995, 10, 1)]
    }
})

# Extract part keys of promotional parts
promo_part_keys = [part['P_PARTKEY'] for part in promotional_parts]

# Define the SQL query
sql_query = """
SELECT
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS promo_revenue

    lineitem

    L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-09-01' AND '1995-10-01'
    AND L_PARTKEY IN (%s)
""" % ','.join(['%s'] * len(promo_part_keys))

# Execute the SQL query
mysql_cursor.execute(sql_query, promo_part_keys)

# Fetch result
promo_revenue = mysql_cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Calculate total revenue in the time range
mysql_cursor.execute("""

    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue

total_revenue = mysql_cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Calculate the promotion effect percentage
promo_effect_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Write the output to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['promo_effect_percentage'])
    writer.writerow([promo_effect_percentage])

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

Now, here's the bash script to install all the dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Setup Python environment and install dependencies
pip install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to give the bash script execution permissions before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
