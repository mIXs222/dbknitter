```python

mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Execute MySQL query
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    mysql_results = cursor.fetchall()

# Fetch data from MongoDB with aggregation

```

2. Below is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt update

# Install Python3 and Pip if they are not installed
apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please note that the above scripts assume a Unix-like environment with `apt` as the package manager and Python 3 with pip installed. Adjust the scripts to suit your actual environment and package management system if necessary. Additionally, for security, credentials should not be hardcoded into scripts, and access control for databases should be properly managed. The provided MySQL query part in the script is fictional as the necessary relationships and conditions are not described in your scenario.
