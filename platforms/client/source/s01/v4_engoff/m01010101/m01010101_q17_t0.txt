This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments., The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a brand 23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is your requested Python code (save as `query_code.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongodb['lineitem']

# Fetch parts with a specific brand from MySQL
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part WHERE P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'")
part_keys = [result[0] for result in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Calculate average quantity in line items from MongoDB
avg_quantity_pipeline = [
    {"$match": {
        "L_PARTKEY": {"$in": part_keys}
    }},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": None,
        "avg_quantity": {"$avg": "$L_QUANTITY"}
    }}
]
cursor = lineitem_collection.aggregate(avg_quantity_pipeline)
avg_quantity_result = list(cursor)
avg_quantity = avg_quantity_result[0]['avg_quantity'] if avg_quantity_result else 0

# Calculate the average yearly loss in revenue for parts with less quantity
loss_revenue_pipeline = [
    {"$match": {
        "L_PARTKEY": {"$in": part_keys},
        "L_QUANTITY": {"$lt": avg_quantity * 0.2}
    }},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": "$L_ORDERKEY",
        "loss_revenue": {"$sum": {"$multiply": ["$L_QUANTITY", "$L_EXTENDEDPRICE"]}}
    }}
]
cursor = lineitem_collection.aggregate(loss_revenue_pipeline)

# Calculate average yearly loss
total_loss_revenue = sum([doc['loss_revenue'] for doc in cursor])
years_in_dataset = 7  # Assuming data covers 7 years
avg_yearly_loss_revenue = total_loss_revenue / years_in_dataset

# Write the result to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['average_yearly_loss_revenue'])
    csvwriter.writerow([avg_yearly_loss_revenue])
```

And here is your Bash script to install the dependencies (save as `install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Updating package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql

# Install PyMongo
pip3 install pymongo
```

Please remember to give execution permissions to the bash script:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

And then, run the script to install the dependencies:
```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```
