If several suppliers in that EUROPE offers the BRASS part and size of 15 at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the suppliers with the order by account balance in descending order, and nation name, supplier name, part key in ascending order. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

And here is the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python if it's not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
