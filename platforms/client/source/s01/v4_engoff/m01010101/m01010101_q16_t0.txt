It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (query.py):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
    charset='utf8mb4'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get supplier keys with complaints from MongoDB
complaint_suppliers = set()
for supplier in mongo_db.supplier.find({"S_COMMENT": {"$regex": ".*Customer.*Complaints.*"}}):
    complaint_suppliers.add(supplier['S_SUPPKEY'])

# Define sizes and execute the query for MySQL
sizes = (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
try:
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        sql = """
        SELECT P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) as supplier_count
        FROM part JOIN partsupp ON part.P_PARTKEY = partsupp.PS_PARTKEY
        WHERE P_SIZE IN %s AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45' AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%%'
        GROUP BY P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE 
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) > 0
        ORDER BY supplier_count DESC, P_BRAND ASC, P_TYPE ASC, P_SIZE ASC;
        """
        cursor.execute(sql, (sizes,))
        results = cursor.fetchall()
finally:
    mysql_conn.close()

# Exclude suppliers with complaints
filtered_results = [
    row for row in results if row[3] not in complaint_suppliers
]

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["P_BRAND", "P_TYPE", "P_SIZE", "SUPPLIER_COUNT"])
    for result in filtered_results:
        writer.writerow(result)
```

And here is the bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install the required dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Updating package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python pip if not present
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MySQL client
apt-get install -y default-mysql-client

# Install pymongo with pip
pip3 install pymongo

# Install PyMySQL with pip
pip3 install pymysql
