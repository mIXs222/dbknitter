This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that will execute the query across your different databases and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connection to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql', 
    user='root', 
    password='my-secret-pw', 
    database='tpch'
)

# Connection to the MongoDB database
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Function to get the customer data from MongoDB
def get_customers():
    country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
    seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)
    customer_data = mongo_db['customer'].find({
        'C_PHONE': {'$regex': '^(20|40|22|30|39|42|21)'},
        'C_ACCTBAL': {'$gt': 0}
    })
    return {
        cust['C_CUSTKEY']: {
            'C_NAME': cust['C_NAME'],
            'C_ACCTBAL': cust['C_ACCTBAL'],
            'C_PHONE': cust['C_PHONE']
        }
        for cust in customer_data
    }

# Function to query orders from MySQL
def get_orders_for_customers(customer_keys):
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        format_strings = ','.join(['%s'] * len(customer_keys))
        customer_keys_tuple = tuple(customer_keys)
        cursor.execute(f"""
            SELECT O_CUSTKEY 
            FROM orders 
            WHERE O_CUSTKEY IN ({format_strings}) 
            AND O_ORDERDATE >= %s
        """, customer_keys_tuple + (seven_years_ago,))
        return {row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()}

# Process the data and output to CSV
customers = get_customers()
orders = get_orders_for_customers(customers.keys())
filtered_customers = {
    k: v for k, v in customers.items() if k not in orders
}

with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['C_NAME', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'C_PHONE']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    
    writer.writeheader()
    for customer in filtered_customers.values():
        writer.writerow(customer)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install pip if it's not already installed
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
