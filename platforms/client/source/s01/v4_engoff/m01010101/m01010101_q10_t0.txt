The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue, customer key, customer name and customer account balance.

response, 1. Here is the Python code that connects to both MySQL and MongoDB, executes the necessary queries or aggregations, merges the results, and outputs them to a file named `query_output.csv`:

```python
import csv
import pymysql
import pymongo
from decimal import Decimal
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', passwd='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Run query on MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, N_NAME, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_COMMENT
FROM customer
INNER JOIN nation ON C_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
"""

try:
    mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    customers = {row[0]: list(row[1:]) for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()}
finally:
    mysql_cursor.close()
    mysql_conn.close()

# Run aggregation on MongoDB
start_date = datetime(1993, 10, 1)
end_date = datetime(1994, 1, 1)

# Output results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:

```

2. Here is the Bash script to install all necessary dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install MySQL client
apt-get install -y default-mysql-client

# Install Python and Pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymongo pymysql
