The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line.

response, Here is the requested Python code to execute the query across databases and write the results to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# python_code.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get parts and partsupp data from MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME FROM part")
    parts = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.execute("SELECT PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY, PS_SUPPLYCOST FROM partsupp")
    partsupp = cursor.fetchall()

# Filtering parts containing 'dim' in their names and creating a dictionary for faster access
parts_with_dim = {p[0]: p[1] for p in parts if 'dim' in p[1].lower()}

# Create a dictionary to match PS_PARTKEY to PS_SUPPLYCOST
supply_cost_dict = {ps[0]: ps[2] for ps in partsupp if ps[0] in parts_with_dim.keys()}

# Get nation data from MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME FROM nation ORDER BY N_NAME ASC")
    nations = cursor.fetchall()

# Create a dictionary to match N_NATIONKEY to N_NAME
nation_dict = {n[0]: n[1] for n in nations}

# Get the required data from MongoDB 'supplier' and 'lineitem' collections
suppliers = list(mongodb.supplier.find({}, {"S_SUPPKEY": 1, "S_NATIONKEY": 1}))
lineitems = list(mongodb.lineitem.find({}, {"L_PARTKEY": 1, "L_SUPPKEY": 1, "L_QUANTITY": 1, "L_EXTENDEDPRICE": 1, "L_DISCOUNT": 1, "L_SHIPDATE": 1}))

# Join the necessary data and calculate the profit

                    profit_dict[nation][year] += profit
                else:
                    profit_dict[nation][year] = profit
            else:
                profit_dict[nation] = {year: profit}

# Sorting the result by nation and within each nation by year in descending order
sorted_profit = [(nation, year, profit_dict[nation][year]) for nation in sorted(profit_dict)
                 for year in sorted(profit_dict[nation], reverse=True)]

# Writing the result to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['NATION', 'YEAR', 'PROFIT'])
    for row in sorted_profit:
        writer.writerow(row)

# Close the database connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

Below is the corresponding Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# bash_script.sh

# Assuming you have Python installed, you can install dependencies using pip.
# The script should be run with administrative privileges if necessary.

# Update package list and install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the Python MySQL and MongoDB libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
