Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here's the Python code to execute the combined query across the MySQL and Redis databases:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
from datetime import datetime

# Establish connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch',
)

# Query MySQL to get order details
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    query = '''
    SELECT
        o.O_ORDERKEY,
        o.O_SHIPPRIORITY,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) as revenue
    FROM
        orders o
    JOIN
        lineitem l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    WHERE
        l.L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
    GROUP BY
        o.O_ORDERKEY
    ORDER BY
        revenue DESC;
    '''
    cursor.execute(query)
    orders_result = cursor.fetchall()

# Transform MySQL data to DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_result, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'revenue'])

# Establish connection to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get customer data from Redis
customer_data = redis_client.get('customer')
customers_df = pd.read_json(customer_data)

# Convert to DataFrame if returned as a string
if isinstance(customers_df, str):
    customers_df = pd.read_json(customers_df)

# Filtering customers with 'BUILDING' market segment
building_customers_df = customers_df[customers_df['C_MKTSEGMENT'] == 'BUILDING']

# Merge orders and customers data on 'C_CUSTKEY' and 'O_CUSTKEY' respectively
merged_df = orders_df.merge(building_customers_df, how='inner', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Get the top orders by revenue
top_orders_df = merged_df.nlargest(1, 'revenue')

# Select required columns and write to csv
result_df = top_orders_df[['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'revenue']]
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
```

2. Here's the Bash script to install necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh
# Ensure pip is installed
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Upgrade pip to the latest version
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql direct_redis pandas
```

Ensure that the Bash script is executable by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
