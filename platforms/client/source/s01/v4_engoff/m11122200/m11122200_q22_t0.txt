This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# mysql_redis_query.py
import pymysql
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd
import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

# Query to get customers' details from MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT O_CUSTKEY
FROM orders
WHERE O_ORDERDATE < %s
GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
HAVING COUNT(*) = 0
"""

seven_years_ago = (datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7*365)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(mysql_query, (seven_years_ago,))
result = cursor.fetchall()
cust_keys_with_no_orders = [row[0] for row in result]
cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis and get customer details
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)
customer_data = redis_conn.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_json(customer_data, orient='records')

# Filter customers based on conditions
filtered_customers = customer_df[customer_df['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(cust_keys_with_no_orders)]
filtered_customers = filtered_customers[filtered_customers['C_PHONE'].str[:2].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])]
filtered_customers = filtered_customers[filtered_customers['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.0]

# Group by country code and calculate average balance
grouped_customers = filtered_customers.groupby(filtered_customers['C_PHONE'].str[:2])
final_result = grouped_customers.agg(customer_count=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'),
                                     average_balance=('C_ACCTBAL', 'mean')).reset_index()
final_result.rename(columns={'C_PHONE': 'country_code'}, inplace=True)

# Write to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies:

```sh
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Install the necessary Python libraries.
pip install pymysql direct_redis pandas
```

Please make sure to have Python and `pip` installed beforehand, and add execution permission to the bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`. Run the script to install the dependencies before executing the Python code.
