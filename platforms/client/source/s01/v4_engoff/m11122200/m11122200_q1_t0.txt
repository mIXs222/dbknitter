Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped before 1998-09-02. The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that connects to the MySQL database and executes the query to fetch the required data, and then writes the output to the file `query_output.csv`:

```python
# Write the Python code to a file named 'execute_query.py'
with open('execute_query.py', 'w') as file:
    file.write("""import pymysql
import csv

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

# SQL Query as per the requirement
sql_query = '''
SELECT 
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE < '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
ORDER BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS;
'''

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        result_set = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write the result to a CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            # Write header
            csv_writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])
            # Write data
            for row in result_set:
                csv_writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    # Close the database connection
    connection.close()
""")
```

And below is the Bash script to install all the dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
# Write the Bash script to a file named 'install_dependencies.sh'
with open('install_dependencies.sh', 'w') as file:
    file.write("""#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pymysql
""")
```

Remember to give the execute permission for the bash script:
```
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
Then you can run `./install_dependencies.sh` before `python3 execute_query.py` to install all the required dependencies and execute the Python code.

Please note: When executing the above Python code, ensure that the MySQL server is running and the hostname `mysql`, database `tpch`, and the provided credentials are correctly set up and accessible from the environment where you run your Python script.
