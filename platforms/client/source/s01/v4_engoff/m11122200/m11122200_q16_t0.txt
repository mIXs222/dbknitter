It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that performs the aforementioned query:

```python
# File: query_execute.py

import pymongo
import redis
import pandas as pd

# Connecting to MongoDB
def connect_to_mongodb():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
    db = client["tpch"]
    return db

# Fetching data from MongoDB
def fetch_mongodb_data(db):
    part_collection = db["part"]
    parts_data = list(part_collection.find({"$and": [
        {"P_BRAND": {"$ne": "Brand#45"}},
        {"P_TYPE": {"$not": {"$regex": "MEDIUM POLISHED"}}},
        {"P_SIZE": {"$in": [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]}}
    ]}, projection={'_id': False}))
    return pd.DataFrame(parts_data)

# Connecting to Redis
def connect_to_redis():
    rd = redis.StrictRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)
    return rd

# Fetching data from Redis
def fetch_redis_data(rd):
    supplier_data = rd.get('supplier')
    partsupp_data = rd.get('partsupp')

    supplier_df = pd.read_json(supplier_data)
    partsupp_df = pd.read_json(partsupp_data)

    # Filter suppliers without complaints (assuming complaints are indicated in S_COMMENT)
    supplier_no_complaints = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains("Customer Complaints")]

    return partsupp_df.merge(supplier_no_complaints, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY', how='inner')

# Main logic
def main():
    # Database connections
    mongodb_db = connect_to_mongodb()
    redis_db = connect_to_redis()

    # Fetch data
    parts_df = fetch_mongodb_data(mongodb_db)
    partsupp_df = fetch_redis_data(redis_db)

    # Combine DataFrames on partkey
    combined_df = partsupp_df.merge(parts_df, left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

    # Count suppliers and sort the results as specified
    result = combined_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).size().reset_index(name='SUPPLIER_COUNT')
    result = result.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_COUNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

    # Write results to CSV
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
# File: install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 if not installed
sudo apt-get install python3

# Install MongoDB Python Driver - pymongo
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install pymongo

# Install Redis Python Client and Pandas
python3 -m pip install redis pandas

# Note: Since the 'direct_redis.DirectRedis' client is not a standard library and its source is not provided,
# I have used the standard 'redis.StrictRedis' client instead. If 'direct_redis' were a custom or third-party package,
# you would need to include additional installation steps or provide the package with your deployment.
