The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue, customer key, customer name and customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems., \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Group by O_CUSTKEY and sum the lost revenues
mysql_revenue = mysql_result.groupby('O_CUSTKEY')['LOST_REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()

```

Now, here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and install pip for Python3 if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Make sure to mark the Bash script as executable and run it before executing the Python script:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh

# After dependencies are installed, run the Python script with:
python3 query.py
