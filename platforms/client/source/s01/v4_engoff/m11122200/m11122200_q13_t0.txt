This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Firstly, here is the Python code to address the multi-database query:

```python
# File: multi_db_query.py

import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def query_mysql():
    conn_info = {
        'host': 'mysql',
        'user': 'root',
        'password': 'my-secret-pw',
        'db': 'tpch'
    }
    try:
        conn = pymysql.connect(**conn_info)
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        query = """
        SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) AS order_count
        FROM orders
        WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS NOT IN ('pending', 'deposits')
        GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
        """
        cursor.execute(query)
        mysql_df = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'order_count'])
    finally:
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()
    return mysql_df

def query_redis():
    redis_info = {
        'host': 'redis',
        'port': 6379,
        'db': 0
    }
    redis_client = DirectRedis(**redis_info)
    customer_data = redis_client.get('customer')
    redis_df = pd.read_json(customer_data)
    return redis_df

def main():
    mysql_data = query_mysql()
    redis_data = query_redis()
    combined_data = pd.merge(redis_data, mysql_data, on='C_CUSTKEY', how='left')
    combined_data['order_count'] = combined_data['order_count'].fillna(0).astype(int)
    distribution = combined_data.groupby('order_count').size().reset_index(name='customer_count')
    distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Next, the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: setup.sh

# Update package list and install pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymysql direct-redis
```

Please note that the `direct_redis.DirectRedis` and the function `get('tablename')` used for querying Redis are made-up for this problem statement, and don't directly reflect the actual implementation in typical Python Redis clients. These would need to be adapted or created according to the actual requirements or available libraries.

Make sure to give execute permission to the bash script if you're going to run it:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

And then run it to install the dependencies:

```bash
./setup.sh
```
