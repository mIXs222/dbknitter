Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level., The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the customers who have ever placed quantity orders larger than 300. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested, saved as `query_code.py`:

```python
import pymysql
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql', 
    user='root', 
    password='my-secret-pw', 
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the data from MySQL
query = """
SELECT o.O_ORDERKEY, o.O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_TOTALPRICE, SUM(l.L_QUANTITY) as total_quantity
FROM orders o 
JOIN lineitem l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
GROUP BY o.O_ORDERKEY, o.O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_TOTALPRICE
HAVING total_quantity > 300;
"""
mysql_data = pd.read_sql(query, mysql_conn)

# Get the data from Redis and convert to DataFrame
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('customer'))
customer_data.columns = ['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 'C_NATIONKEY', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'C_MKTSEGMENT', 'C_COMMENT']

# Merge MySQL and Redis data
result = pd.merge(
    mysql_data,
    customer_data,
    left_on="O_CUSTKEY",
    right_on="C_CUSTKEY"
)[['C_NAME', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'total_quantity']]

# Write the result to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script to install the dependencies, saved as `install_dependencies.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip if not installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql direct_redis pandas
