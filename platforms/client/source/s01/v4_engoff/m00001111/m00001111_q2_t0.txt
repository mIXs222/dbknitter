If several suppliers in that EUROPE offers the BRASS part and size of 15 at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the suppliers with the order by account balance in descending order, and nation name, supplier name, part key in ascending order. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query across different databases:

### `execute_query.py`
```python

mysql_cursor = mysql_connection.cursor()

# First, get suppliers from the EUROPE region supplying BRASS parts of size 15
mysql_cursor.execute("""

```

For the bash script that installs all dependencies, here is the content:

### `install_dependencies.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Install Python and Pip if not installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install dependencies using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to grant the execute permission to the bash script by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
