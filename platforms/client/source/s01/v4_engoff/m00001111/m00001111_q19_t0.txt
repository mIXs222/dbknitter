The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the given query across the MySQL and MongoDB databases:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client.tpch

# Query parts from MySQL
sql_query = """
    SELECT * FROM part WHERE 
    (P_BRAND = 'Brand#12' AND
    P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND
    P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
    OR
    (P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND
    P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND
    P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
    OR
    (P_BRAND = 'Brand#34' AND
    P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND
    P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15);
"""

parts_df = pd.read_sql(sql_query, con=mysql_conn)

# Query lineitem from MongoDB
mongo_query = {
    'L_SHIPMODE': {'$in': ['AIR', 'AIR REG']},
    'L_SHIPINSTRUCT': 'DELIVER IN PERSON',
    '$or': [
        {'L_QUANTITY': {'$gte': 1, '$lte': 11}},
        {'L_QUANTITY': {'$gte': 10, '$lte': 20}},
        {'L_QUANTITY': {'$gte': 20, '$lte': 30}}
    ]
}
lineitems = mongodb.lineitem.find(mongo_query)
lineitems_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitems))

# Join the dataframes
result_df = pd.merge(parts_df, lineitems_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the gross discounted revenue
result_df['REVENUE'] = result_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - result_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Select only required columns 
result_df = result_df[['L_ORDERKEY', 'REVENUE']]

# Write results to file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the bash script to install all the dependencies for the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package manager
apt-get update -y

# Install pip and Python development files (might already be installed)
apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev -y

# Install the required python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas
```

Make sure to make the bash script executable by running the command `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` after creating it.
