The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code that would execute the cross-database query, assuming the document in MongoDB has a relational table-like structure. Save this to a file named `query.py`:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connection to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connection to the MongoDB database
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongo_db['lineitem']

# Get all promotional parts from MySQL
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part")
promotional_parts_set = {row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()}

# Query the lineitems from MongoDB
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 10, 1)
lineitems = lineitem_collection.find({
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lt': end_date}
})

# Calculate the revenue contribution of promotional parts
total_revenue = 0.0
promo_revenue = 0.0
for lineitem in lineitems:
    revenue = lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem['L_DISCOUNT'])
    total_revenue += revenue
    if lineitem['L_PARTKEY'] in promotional_parts_set:
        promo_revenue += revenue

# Calculate the percentage
if total_revenue > 0:
    promo_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100
else:
    promo_percentage = 0

# Write output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['Promotion Effect Percentage'])
    csvwriter.writerow([promo_percentage])

# Close database connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the corresponding Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code. Save the script as `install_deps.sh` and execute it in your environment:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and Pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
``` 

Please note that you might need to adjust permissions and execution environment according to the specifics of your system and users' privileges.
