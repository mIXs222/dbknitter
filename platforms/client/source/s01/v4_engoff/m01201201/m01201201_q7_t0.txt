The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

2. Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Do not forget to give execute permission to the bash script after creating it using the command:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
