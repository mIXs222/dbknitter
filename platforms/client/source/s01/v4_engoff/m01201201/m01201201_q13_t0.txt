This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query_executer.py`) to execute the query:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Execute MySQL query and close the connection
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS NOT IN ('PENDING', 'DEPOSIT') GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY")
    orders_result = cursor.fetchall()
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the customer table from Redis
customer_data = eval(redis.get('customer'))

# Create DataFrame from the Redis data
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(customer_data, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 
                                                   'C_NATIONKEY', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL', 
                                                   'C_MKTSEGMENT', 'C_COMMENT'])

# Create DataFrame from the MySQL data
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_result), columns=['O_CUSTKEY', 'ORDER_COUNT'])

# Convert CUSTKEYs to integers to ensure proper join
customer_df['C_CUSTKEY'] = customer_df['C_CUSTKEY'].astype(int)
orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'] = orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'].astype(int)

# Merge customers with orders DataFrame to include customers with no orders
merged_df = pd.merge(customer_df, orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left')

# Replace NaN with 0 for customers without orders
merged_df['ORDER_COUNT'] = merged_df['ORDER_COUNT'].fillna(0)

# Get the distribution of customers by the number of orders
customer_distribution = merged_df['ORDER_COUNT'].value_counts().sort_index().reset_index()
customer_distribution.columns = ['NUMBER_OF_ORDERS', 'CUSTOMER_COUNT']

# Write query's output to a csv file
customer_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip -y

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct-redis
```

Please make sure you have the appropriate permissions to execute the script and that Python 3 is present on the system.
