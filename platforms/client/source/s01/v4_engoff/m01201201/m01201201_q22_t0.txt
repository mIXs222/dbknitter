This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that would execute the given query on your original data:

```python
# code.py

import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Establish connection to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# Query to check for customers in MySQL 'orders' table who have not placed orders for the last 7 years
seven_years_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
sql_query = """
SELECT O_CUSTKEY FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERDATE < %s
"""
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(sql_query, (seven_years_ago,))
    custkeys_with_old_orders = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

# Close the connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Establish connection to the Redis database
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch 'customer' table stored in Redis
customer_data = redis_conn.get('customer')
df_customer = pd.read_json(customer_data)

# Filter for specific country codes based on the phone number and account balance
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
df_filtered_customers = df_customer[(df_customer['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2).isin(country_codes)) &
                                    (df_customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.00) &
                                    (~df_customer['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(custkeys_with_old_orders))]

# Aggregate required information
result = df_filtered_customers.groupby(df_customer['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2)).agg(
    customer_count=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'),
    avg_balance=('C_ACCTBAL', 'mean')
).reset_index()

# Write the result to CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the .sh bash script to install all dependencies required to run the Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package index
apt-get update

# Install Python3 if not already installed, pip and Redis server
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip redis-server

# Install Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymysql redis direct-redis

# Start the Redis server (if not already running, commenting out if the redis server is not accessed from your local)
# /etc/init.d/redis-server start
```

Please ensure that you have the correct permissions to run the bash script and that Python and pip are compatible with the libraries we're installing. Additionally, the Redis Python library may require additional configuration to correctly interface with your Redis instance, and the operation of the Redis server is outside the scope of this script.
