The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode which is MAIL and SHIP, for lineitems actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
