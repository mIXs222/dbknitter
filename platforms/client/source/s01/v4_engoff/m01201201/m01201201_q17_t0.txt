What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code required to execute this query:

```python
# query.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongodb['lineitem']
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find(
    {'L_SHIPMODE': {'$exists': True}},
    {'_id': 0, 'L_PARTKEY': 1, 'L_QUANTITY': 1, 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE': 1}
)))

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(port=6379, host='redis')
part_data = pd.read_json(redis.get('part'), orient='records')

# Filter parts with the specified brand and type
target_parts = part_data[(part_data['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_data['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Filter lineitems with the specified parts
target_lineitems = lineitem_data[lineitem_data['L_PARTKEY'].isin(target_parts['P_PARTKEY'])]

# Calculate the average quantity
average_quantity = target_lineitems['L_QUANTITY'].mean()

# Calculate the threshold (20% of the average quantity)
threshold_quantity = 0.2 * average_quantity

# Filter orders with less than the threshold quantity
small_quantity_orders = target_lineitems[target_lineitems['L_QUANTITY'] < threshold_quantity]

# Calculate the total loss in revenue
total_loss_revenue = small_quantity_orders['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()

# Calculate the average yearly loss in revenue (assuming a 7-year span)
average_yearly_loss_revenue = total_loss_revenue / 7

# Save to CSV
result = pd.DataFrame({'Average_Yearly_Loss_Revenue': [average_yearly_loss_revenue]})
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the repository information
apt-get update -y

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis

# Install direct_redis separately if not available as a regular PyPI package
# The code assumes that direct_redis is a package that can be installed.
# If it's a custom library, this would need to be adapted to the correct installation method.
pip3 install direct_redis

# Run the Python script
python3 query.py
```

Note: If `direct_redis` is not an installable package, it needs to be provided or installed in a different manner, potentially by manually placing the necessary files in a directory accessible to the script.
