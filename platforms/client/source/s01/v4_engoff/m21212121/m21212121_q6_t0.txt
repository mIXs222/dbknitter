message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 with discounts between .06 - 0.01 and .06 + 0.01. The query lists the amount by which the total revenue would have increased if these discounts had been eliminated for lineitems with l_quantity less than 24. Note that the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
