Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code:

```python
# query.py

import pymongo
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Function to convert revenue data to proper format for market share calculation.
def calculate_market_share(year_revenues, total_revenues):
    shares = []
    for year in sorted(year_revenues):
        if total_revenues != 0:
            share = year_revenues[year] / total_revenues
        else:
            share = 0
        shares.append(share)
    return shares

def main():
    # Connect to MongoDB
    mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
    db = mongo_client.tpch
    
    # MongoDB collections to pandas dataframes
    suppliers = pd.DataFrame(list(db.supplier.find({"S_NATIONKEY": "INDA"})))
    lineitems = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find({"L_SHIPDATE": {'$regex': '^(199[56]).*'}})))
    
    # Establish Redis connection
    redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

    # Redis dataframes
    nations_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_client.hgetall('nation'))
    parts_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_client.hgetall('part'))
    orders_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_client.hgetall('orders'))
    
    # Filter parts for 'SMALL PLATED COPPER' and convert Redis hash to DataFrame
    parts = pd.read_json(parts_df.loc['part'].values[0])  # Assuming part is stored as a JSON string
    parts = parts[parts['P_TYPE'] == 'SMALL PLATED COPPER']
    
    # Join lineitems to parts and further to suppliers on their keys
    line_parts_suppliers = pd.merge(lineitems, parts, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
    # Note: Considering 'S_SUPPKEY' as 's_suppkey'
    line_parts_suppliers = pd.merge(line_parts_suppliers, suppliers, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
    
    # Filter by ASIA

    total_revenue_asia = sum(years_revenue.values())
    
    # Calculate market shares for 1995 and 1996
    market_shares = calculate_market_share(years_revenue, total_revenue_asia)
    
    # Write the result to a CSV file
    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['1995 Market Share', '1996 Market Share'])
        writer.writerow(market_shares)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And here is the requested Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# update package index
sudo apt-get update

# install Python and pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# install necessary python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis

# Note: direct_redis is not a standard python package and cannot be installed via pip.
# You may need to include the direct_redis module in your project or install it from a provided source.
```

Please note, the provided python code assumes that the Redis data for 'nation' and 'part' are stored as hash maps with all entries being JSON strings, which is not standard Redis usage. However, as no direct Redis operation for 'hgetall' was mentioned that converts data directly to Pandas DataFrame, the use of `.hgetall` returning a hash map, then manually interpreting one of the hashes as JSON into a DataFrame, is a placeholder for whatever proprietary parsing the `direct_redis.DirectRedis` is doing in your setup. For proper implementation, you will need the details of the custom `DirectRedis` library.
