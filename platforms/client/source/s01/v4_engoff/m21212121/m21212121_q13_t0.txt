This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the requested Python code (`query.py`):

```python
import pymongo
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = client["tpch"]
customer_collection = mongo_db["customer"]

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get customer data from MongoDB
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_collection.find({})), columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 'C_NATIONKEY', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'C_MKTSEGMENT', 'C_COMMENT'])

# Get order data from Redis as DataFrame, assuming that data is stored in a way that pandas can understand
# Extracted data from Redis would need to be converted from string or bytes to a format that pandas can understand
orders_data = redis_connection.get('orders')

# Assuming that orders_data is already in a format that can be read directly by pandas
orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_data, orient='records')

# Merge DataFrames on customer key
merged_df = pd.merge(customer_df, orders_df, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')

# Exclude pending and deposits orders
filtered_df = merged_df[~merged_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', na=False)]

# Count orders per customer
order_counts = filtered_df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY')['O_ORDERKEY'].nunique().reset_index(name='order_count')

# Count the distribution of order counts, including customers with zero orders
distribution_counts = order_counts['order_count'].value_counts().sort_index().reset_index(name='customer_count')
distribution_counts.rename(columns={'index': 'number_of_orders'}, inplace=True)

# Write to CSV
distribution_counts.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the requested Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install direct_redis, which likely requires installing the git 
# because it seems to be a custom package not available in PyPi
# This is just a placeholder line assuming direct_redis is available in a git repository
# Substitute <git_repo_url> with the actual URL of the git repository
# git clone <git_repo_url>
# cd direct_redis
# python3 setup.py install
# cd ..

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

Please note that for the Redis section of the Python code, I assumed that `orders_data` obtained from `redis_connection.get('orders')` is a JSON string that can be directly converted into a Pandas DataFrame. In practice, the data in Redis might be stored in a different format that would require additional processing.

Additionally, `direct_redis.DirectRedis` does not look like a standard library. Thus, the corresponding installation command in the Bash script was commented out and would need to be updated with the actual procedure to install `direct_redis`.
