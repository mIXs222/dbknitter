It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute this query (.py):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from bson import ObjectId
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
supplier_collection = mongo_db["supplier"]

# Redis connection setup
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve data from MongoDB
suppliers_with_complaints = list(supplier_collection.find({'S_COMMENT': {'$regex': '.*Customer.*Complaints.*'}}, {'S_SUPPKEY': 1}))
suppliers_with_complaints_set = set([doc['S_SUPPKEY'] for doc in suppliers_with_complaints])

# Retrieve data from Redis
parts_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('part'))  # Redis should return data as a JSON string
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('partsupp'))

# Filter parts according to the criteria
filtered_parts = parts_df[
    (parts_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9])) &
    (parts_df['P_TYPE'] != 'MEDIUM POLISHED') &
    (parts_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45')
]

# Merge tables and apply final filters
result = (
    filtered_parts
    .merge(partsupp_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')
    .query('~PS_SUPPKEY in @suppliers_with_complaints_set')
    .groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])
    .agg({'PS_SUPPKEY': 'nunique'})
    .rename(columns={'PS_SUPPKEY': 'supplier_count'})
    .sort_values(['supplier_count', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])
    .reset_index()
)

# Write results to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code (.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and Python package manager (pip)
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and redis-py
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct-redis

# Note: Instructions assume queryset is in 'query.py' and script is in 'install_dependencies.sh'
# Make script executable with 'chmod +x install_dependencies.sh'
# Run the script with './install_dependencies.sh'

```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run the bash script and access the services. Adjust the script to fit your environment's specific needs.
