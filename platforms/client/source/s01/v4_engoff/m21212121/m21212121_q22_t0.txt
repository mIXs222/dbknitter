This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on your original data:

```python
# sales_opportunity.py
import pymongo
from bson.json_util import dumps
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_customers_collection = mongo_db['customer']

# Query MongoDB for customers data
query = { 
    'C_PHONE': {'$regex': '^(20|40|22|30|39|42|21)'},
    'C_ACCTBAL': {'$gt': 0.0},
}
mongo_customers_cursor = mongo_customers_collection.find(query, {'_id': 0})
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_customers_cursor))

# Connection to Redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query Redis for orders data
orders_data_json = r.get('orders')
orders_data = pd.read_json(orders_data_json, orient='split')

# Filter out orders older than 7 years
seven_years_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)).date()
orders_data = orders_data[orders_data['O_ORDERDATE'] > str(seven_years_ago)]

# Find customers with no orders in the last 7 years
customers_no_recent_orders = customer_data[~customer_data['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(orders_data['O_CUSTKEY'])]

# Group by the first two characters of c_phone and calculate mean account balance
result = (customers_no_recent_orders.groupby(customers_no_recent_orders['C_PHONE'].str[:2])['C_ACCTBAL']
          .agg(['count', 'mean'])
          .reset_index()
          .rename(columns={'C_PHONE': 'Country_Code', 'count': 'Customer_Count', 'mean': 'Average_AcctBal'}))

# Write query result to csv file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip and Python development files
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install pymongo for MongoDB connection
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas for data manipulation
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis for Redis connection
pip3 install direct_redis

# Note that the above commands assume a Debian/Ubuntu-based system,
# and correct privileges (or use of `sudo`) for package installation.
