What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python Code (query_code.py):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import redis
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongodb['lineitem']

# Redis connection
r = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get data from Redis
part_df_json = r.get('part')
part_df = pd.read_json(part_df_json)

# Filter parts with brand 23 and container type 'MED BAG'
filtered_parts = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Get lineitem data from MongoDB
lineitems = list(lineitem_collection.find(
    {
        'L_PARTKEY': {'$in': filtered_parts['P_PARTKEY'].tolist()}
    },
    {
        '_id': 0,
        'L_ORDERKEY': 1, 'L_PARTKEY': 1, 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE': 1, 'L_QUANTITY': 1
    }
))
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitems)

# Calculate the average quantity ordered for these parts across all orders
avg_quantity = lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()

# Calculate the average yearly revenue that would be lost
threshold_quantity = avg_quantity * 0.2
lost_revenue_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] < threshold_quantity]

# Group by year (extract year from L_SHIPDATE)
lost_revenue_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lost_revenue_df['L_SHIPDATE'])
lost_revenue_df['YEAR'] = lost_revenue_df['L_SHIPDATE'].dt.year

# Calculate the average yearly gross loss
average_yearly_loss = lost_revenue_df.groupby('YEAR')['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum().mean()

# Write the output to csv file
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'Average_Yearly_Loss_Revenue': [average_yearly_loss]})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis

# Add execute permissions to the python script
chmod +x query_code.py

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

Please note that for the above bash script to run correctly, it is expected that python3 and pip are installed in the system. Additionally, for real-world deployment, the installation of a virtual environment might vary depending on system configuration and user preferences. The bash script also assumes that the DirectRedis Python package is available for installation via pip, which may not be the case; adjustments might be required if it needs to be installed from a source or if additional dependencies are necessary for Redis or DirectRedis.
