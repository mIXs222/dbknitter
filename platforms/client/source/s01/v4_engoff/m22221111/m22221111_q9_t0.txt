The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query across the different databases:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Load MongoDB tables to pandas DataFrames
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.lineitem.find()))
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.partsupp.find()))

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Load Redis tables to pandas DataFrames
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('nation'))
supplier_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('supplier'))

# Data processing to execute the query

# Join tables
joined_df = lineitem_df.merge(partsupp_df, how='inner', left_on=['L_PARTKEY','L_SUPPKEY'], right_on=['PS_PARTKEY','PS_SUPPKEY'])
joined_df = joined_df.merge(supplier_df, how='inner', left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
joined_df = joined_df.merge(nation_df, how='inner', left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Filter by the specified 'dim' in the part names (L_COMMENT) - replace 'dim' with the actual dimension you are searching for
# joined_df = joined_df[joined_df['L_COMMENT'].str.contains('dim')]

# Calculate profit
joined_df['PROFIT'] = (joined_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - joined_df['L_DISCOUNT'])) - (joined_df['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * joined_df['L_QUANTITY'])

# Extract year from dates
joined_df['YEAR'] = pd.to_datetime(joined_df['L_SHIPDATE']).dt.year

# Group by nation and year, and calculate total profit
result_df = (joined_df.groupby(['N_NAME', 'YEAR'])
             .agg({'PROFIT': 'sum'})
             .sort_values(by=['N_NAME', 'YEAR'], ascending=[True, False])
             .reset_index())

# Save to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Below is the bash script for installing all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MongoDB
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb

# Install Redis
sudo apt-get install -y redis-server

# Install Python packages for MongoDB and Redis
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct_redis

# The script assumes that the MongoDB and Redis servers are accessible and that no additional setup is necessary.
# If you are running this script in a new environment where MongoDB and Redis servers are not setup,
# additional steps might be needed to install and configure these services.
