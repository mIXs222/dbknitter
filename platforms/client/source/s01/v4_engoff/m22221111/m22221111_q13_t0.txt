message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use \'pymongo\' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the required Python code and Bash script.

1. Python code (`query_mongodb.py`):
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# MongoDB connection parameters
db_name = 'tpch'
port = 27017
hostname = 'mongodb'

# Connect to the MongoDB server
client = MongoClient(hostname, port)
db = client[db_name]

# We need to aggregate data from `customer` and `orders`
# We'll join them by customer key and count the orders, excluding certain order comments
pipeline = [
    {
        '$lookup': {
            'from': 'orders',
            'localField': 'C_CUSTKEY',
            'foreignField': 'O_CUSTKEY',
            'as': 'customer_orders'
        }
    },
    {
        '$project': {
            'customer_orders': {
                '$filter': {
                    'input': '$customer_orders',
                    'as': 'order',
                    'cond': {
                        '$and': [
                            {'$ne': ['$$order.O_ORDERSTATUS', 'pending']},
                            {'$ne': ['$$order.O_ORDERSTATUS', 'deposits']},
                            {'$not': {'$regexMatch': {'input': '$$order.O_COMMENT', 'regex': 'pending'}}},
                            {'$not': {'$regexMatch': {'input': '$$order.O_COMMENT', 'regex': 'deposits'}}}
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        '$group': {
            '_id': {'num_orders': {'$size': '$customer_orders'}},
            'customer_count': {'$sum': 1}
        }
    },
    {
        '$sort': {'_id': 1}
    }
]

results = list(db.customer.aggregate(pipeline))

# Write results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['num_orders', 'customer_count'])

    for result in results:
        writer.writerow([result['_id']['num_orders'], result['customer_count']])

# Close the MongoDB connection
client.close()
```

2. Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade the packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install pip for Python3
sudo apt install python3-pip -y

# Install pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymongo
```

Make sure to give the Bash script execute permission by running the following command:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Then, you can execute the bash script to install dependencies as follows:
```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Afterwards, you can run the Python script to perform the query and output the results:
```bash
python3 query_mongodb.py
```
