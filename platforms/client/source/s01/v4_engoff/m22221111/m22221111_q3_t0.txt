Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`query.py`) to execute the query on MongoDB:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# MongoDB connection string
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client["tpch"]

# Aggregation pipeline for MongoDB query
pipeline = [
    {
        "$match": {
            "O_ORDERDATE": {"$lt": "1995-03-15"}, 
            "O_ORDERSTATUS": {"$ne": "shipped"}
        }
    },
    {
        "$lookup": {
            "from": "customer",
            "localField": "O_CUSTKEY",
            "foreignField": "C_CUSTKEY",
            "as": "customer_info"
        }
    },
    {
        "$unwind": "$customer_info"
    },
    {
        "$match": {
            "customer_info.C_MKTSEGMENT": "BUILDING"
        }
    },
    {
        "$lookup": {
            "from": "lineitem",
            "localField": "O_ORDERKEY",
            "foreignField": "L_ORDERKEY",
            "as": "line_items"
        }
    },
    {
        "$unwind": "$line_items"
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": "$O_ORDERKEY",
            "O_SHIPPRIORITY": {"$first": "$O_SHIPPRIORITY"},
            "revenue": {
                "$sum": {
                    "$multiply": [
                        "$line_items.L_EXTENDEDPRICE",
                        {"$subtract": [1, "$line_items.L_DISCOUNT"]}
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "$sort": {
            "revenue": -1
        }
    }
]

# Execute query
result = db["orders"].aggregate(pipeline)

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'revenue']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    for data in result:
        writer.writerow({'O_ORDERKEY': data['_id'], 'O_SHIPPRIORITY': data['O_SHIPPRIORITY'], 'revenue': data['revenue']})
```

Now, here's the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install the Python code dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and Python3-pip if not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Make sure pip is up to date
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install pymongo for MongoDB operations
pip3 install pymongo
