It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query across the different databases:

```python
# python_code.py

import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_collection = mongo_db["partsupp"]

# Redis connection
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

def get_redis_data(table_name):
    data = redis_client.get(table_name)
    return pd.read_json(data) if data else pd.DataFrame()

# Getting partsupp data from MongoDB
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_collection.find()))

# Getting part and supplier data from Redis
part_df = get_redis_data('part')
supplier_df = get_redis_data('supplier')

# Filter parts that do not match criteria
filtered_parts = part_df[
    (part_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45') &
    (part_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9])) &
    (~part_df['P_TYPE'].str.contains("MEDIUM POLISHED"))
]

# Filter suppliers that do not have complaints
filtered_suppliers = supplier_df[
    ~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains("Customer Complaints")
]

# Merge tables on supplier key
result = pd.merge(
    filtered_parts, 
    partsupp_df, 
    left_on='P_PARTKEY', 
    right_on='PS_PARTKEY'
)
result = pd.merge(
    result,
    filtered_suppliers,
    left_on='PS_SUPPKEY',
    right_on='S_SUPPKEY'
)

# Group and count
grouped_result = result.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).agg({'S_SUPPKEY': 'count'}).reset_index()

# Sort the results
sorted_result = grouped_result.sort_values(by=['S_SUPPKEY', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write to CSV file
sorted_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the corresponding Bash script to install all the dependencies necessary to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# bash_script.sh

# Install the required dependencies
pip install pymongo pandas direct-redis

# Run the python script
python python_code.py
```

Please remember to grant the Bash script execution permissions before running it:

```bash
chmod +x bash_script.sh
```

Then, you can execute the Bash script to install dependencies and run the Python code.
