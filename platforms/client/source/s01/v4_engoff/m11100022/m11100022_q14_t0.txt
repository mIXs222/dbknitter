The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code `.py` file content that you can run to execute the merged query:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
from datetime import datetime
import csv

# Establish connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_collection = mongo_db["part"]

# Query MongoDB for parts that are considered promotional
query = {
    "P_NAME": {"$regex": ".*promo.*", "$options": "i"}  # Assuming 'promo' denotes promotional parts
}
promotional_parts = list(mongo_collection.find(query, {"_id": 0, "P_PARTKEY": 1}))
promotional_partkeys = [p['P_PARTKEY'] for p in promotional_parts]

# Establish connection to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read lineitem table from Redis into Pandas DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

# Filter orders shipped in the given date range
start_date = datetime.strptime("1995-09-01", "%Y-%m-%d")
end_date = datetime.strptime("1995-10-01", "%Y-%m-%d")
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])
lineitem_filtered = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) & 
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= end_date)
]

# Calculate revenue from promotional parts
lineitem_filtered['L_REVENUE'] = lineitem_filtered['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_filtered['L_DISCOUNT'])
promo_revenue = lineitem_filtered[
    lineitem_filtered['L_PARTKEY'].isin(promotional_partkeys)
]['L_REVENUE'].sum()

# Calculate total revenue in the same date range
total_revenue = lineitem_filtered['L_REVENUE'].sum()

# Calculate the promotion effect percentage
promotion_effect = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue != 0 else 0

# Output result
output = {'Promotion Effect (%)': promotion_effect}

# Write to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=output.keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerow(output)

# Clean up connections
mongo_client.close()
redis_client.close()
```

Now, here is the Bash script `.sh` file content for installing necessary dependencies:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list on your system
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 pip (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MongoDB driver for Python
pip3 install pymongo

# Install DirectRedis for interacting with Redis
pip3 install direct-redis

# Install Pandas
pip3 install pandas
```
