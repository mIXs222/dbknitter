response, Below is the Python code that should be saved with the `.py` extension and will execute the specified query across your MongoDB and Redis databases. The code fetches the data from both databases, combines them, and performs the necessary calculations to determine the average yearly lost revenue from small quantity orders.

Python code (`query_execution.py`):
```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from MongoDB
part_collection = mongo_db['part']
parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part_collection.find({"P_BRAND": "Brand#23", "P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG"})))

# Fetch data from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

# Filter lineitem df for relevant part keys
part_keys = parts_df['P_PARTKEY'].tolist()
filtered_lineitems = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(part_keys)]

# Calculate average quantity for parts
avg_quantity = filtered_lineitems['L_QUANTITY'].mean()

# Calculate 20% of the average quantity
quantity_threshold = avg_quantity * 0.2

# Filter orders with small quantities
small_quantity_orders = filtered_lineitems[filtered_lineitems['L_QUANTITY'] < quantity_threshold]

# Calculate the total undiscouned revenue loss
small_quantity_orders['UNDISCOUNTED_LOSS'] = small_quantity_orders['L_QUANTITY'] * small_quantity_orders['L_EXTENDEDPRICE']
total_loss = small_quantity_orders['UNDISCOUNTED_LOSS'].sum()

# Considering 7 years of data, calculate the average yearly loss
average_yearly_loss = total_loss / 7

# Write the result to query_output.csv
result_df = pd.DataFrame({'Average_Yearly_Loss': [average_yearly_loss]})
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Below is the Bash script that should be saved with a `.sh` extension and will install all the necessary dependencies to run the Python code above.

Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and Pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the pymongo and direct_redis packages
pip3 install pymongo direct-redis pandas

# Note: Depending on the environment, you may need sudo or different commands to install packages.
```

Make sure to give execution permission to the Bash script using the `chmod` command before running it:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```
