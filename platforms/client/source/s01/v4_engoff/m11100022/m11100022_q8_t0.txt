The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code that will get the data from different data platforms and combine the results according to the description:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Function to connect to MySQL and execute a query
def mysql_query(query):
    connection = pymysql.connect(host="mysql", user="root", password="my-secret-pw", db="tpch")
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(query)
            result = cursor.fetchall()
            columns = [col[0] for col in cursor.description]
            df = pd.DataFrame(result, columns=columns)
    finally:
        connection.close()
    return df

# Function to connect to MongoDB and retrieve data
def mongodb_query(collection):
    client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
    db = client["tpch"]
    data = list(db[collection].find())
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    client.close()
    return df

# Function to connect to Redis and retrieve data as DataFrame
def redis_query(key):
    client = DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)
    df = pd.read_msgpack(client.get(key))
    client.close()
    return df

# MySQL queries for tables supplier and customer
supplier_query = "SELECT * FROM supplier WHERE S_NATIONKEY IN (SELECT N_NATIONKEY FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'INDIA');"
customer_query = "SELECT * FROM customer;"

# Retrieve data from all databases
supplier_df = mysql_query(supplier_query)
customer_df = mysql_query(customer_query)
nation_df = mongodb_query("nation")
region_df = mongodb_query("region")
orders_df = redis_query('orders')
lineitem_df = redis_query('lineitem')

# Join relevant tables
IND_nations = nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'INDIA']['N_NATIONKEY'].tolist()
IND_suppliers = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(IND_nations)]
ASIA_region = region_df[region_df['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA']['R_REGIONKEY'].tolist()
ASIA_nations = nation_df[nation_df['N_REGIONKEY'].isin(ASIA_region)]['N_NATIONKEY'].tolist()

# Filter customers and orders based on ASIA
ASIA_customers = customer_df[customer_df['C_NATIONKEY'].isin(ASIA_nations)]
ASIA_orders = orders_df[orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'].isin(ASIA_customers['C_CUSTKEY'])]

# Prepare data
lineitem_df['L_YEAR'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE']).dt.year
relevant_lineitems = lineitem_df[(lineitem_df['L_YEAR'].isin([1995, 1996])) & (lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].str.contains('SMALL PLATED COPPER'))]
IND_lineitems = relevant_lineitems[relevant_lineitems['L_SUPPKEY'].isin(IND_suppliers['S_SUPPKEY'])]

# Calculate market share for 1995 and 1996
market_share = {}
for year in [1995, 1996]:
    total_revenue = relevant_lineitems[relevant_lineitems['L_YEAR'] == year]['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()
    IND_revenue = IND_lineitems[IND_lineitems['L_YEAR'] == year]['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()
    market_share[year] = IND_revenue / total_revenue if total_revenue else 0

# Write output to CSV
output_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(market_share, orient='index', columns=['Market Share']).reset_index()
output_df.rename(columns={'index': 'Year'}, inplace=True)
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And the bash script for installing all the dependencies needed to run the Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
pip install pymongo
pip install pandas
pip install direct_redis
pip install msgpack-python
```

Save the script as `install_dependencies.sh` and the python code as `execute_query.py`. You will need to run the bash script to install the dependencies before executing the Python code.
