message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date. The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode which is MAIL and SHIP, for lineitems actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that would execute the query based on the given infrastructure and combine the results:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import direct_redis

# Establish connection to Redis database
redis_hostname = 'redis'
redis_port = 6379
redis_db = '0'
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=redis_hostname, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)

# Fetch tables from Redis
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('orders'), orient='records')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Merge datasets on common key
merged_df = pd.merge(orders_df, lineitem_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Define date range
start_date = datetime(1994, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 1, 1)

# Filter data based on conditions
filtered_df = merged_df[
    (merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= start_date) &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] <= end_date) &
    (merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'] < merged_df['L_SHIPDATE']) &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
]

# Define priority levels
high_priority = ['URGENT', 'HIGH']
filtered_df['PRIORITY_LEVEL'] = filtered_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].apply(lambda x: 'HIGH_OR_URGENT' if x in high_priority else 'OTHER')

# Grouping by ship mode and priority level, counting the instances
result = filtered_df.groupby(['L_SHIPMODE', 'PRIORITY_LEVEL']).size().reset_index(name='COUNT')

# Output results to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next, here's the corresponding bash script to install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install the direct_redis package (assuming it is available as package)
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please note that the bash script assumes a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, where `apt-get` is used for package management. Additionally, it assumes that `direct_redis` is available as a Python package; if it's a custom package provided for your infrastructure, you should replace the install command with the appropriate method for installing your custom package.
