The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`query_executer.py`) to execute the given query across the different databases and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Establish a connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get parts that satisfy the conditions from MongoDB
satisfying_parts = list(mongodb['part'].find({
    'P_SIZE': {'$in': [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]},
    'P_TYPE': {'$ne': 'MEDIUM POLISHED'},
    'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'}
}, {'_id': 0, 'P_PARTKEY': 1}))

part_keys = [part['P_PARTKEY'] for part in satisfying_parts]

# Construct a MySQL query to find suppliers without using NOT EXISTS
supplier_query = f"""
SELECT
  PS_SUPPKEY,
  COUNT(DISTINCT PS_PARTKEY) AS PART_COUNT
FROM
  partsupp
WHERE
  PS_PARTKEY IN ({','.join(['%s'] * len(part_keys))})
  AND PS_SUPPKEY NOT IN (
    SELECT S_SUPPKEY
    FROM supplier
    WHERE S_COMMENT LIKE '%%Customer%%Complaints%%'
  )
GROUP BY PS_SUPPKEY
ORDER BY PART_COUNT DESC, S_NAME ASC;
"""

# Execute the MySQL query
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(supplier_query, part_keys)
    supplier_results = cursor.fetchall()

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['SUPPLIER_COUNT'])  # Write the header
    for result in supplier_results:
        writer.writerow(result)  # Write each result row

# Close the connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here's a Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies required to run the Python code above:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Updating package lists
apt-get update

# Installing Python3 and pip if not already installed (assumes you're on a Debian-based system)
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python3 MySQL driver
pip3 install pymysql

# Install Python3 MongoDB driver
pip3 install pymongo
