If several suppliers in that EUROPE offers the BRASS part and size of 15 at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the suppliers with the order by account balance in descending order, and nation name, supplier name, part key in ascending order. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that fulfills your requirement:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')

# Create a MySQL cursor
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Execute the MySQL query for the 'supplier' and 'partsupp' tables
mysql_cursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        S.S_SUPPKEY, S.S_NAME, S.S_ADDRESS, S.S_NATIONKEY, S.S_PHONE,
        S.S_ACCTBAL, S.S_COMMENT, PS.PS_PARTKEY, PS.PS_SUPPLYCOST
    FROM
        supplier S
    JOIN
        partsupp PS ON S.S_SUPPKEY = PS.PS_SUPPKEY
""")
suppliers_partsupps = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Connect to MongoDB database
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Fetch documents from 'part' collection with type BRASS and size 15
brass_parts = list(mongodb_db['part'].find({"P_TYPE": "BRASS", "P_SIZE": 15}, {"_id": 0}))

# Fetch documents from 'nation' collection and transform it to dictionary for quick access
nations = {doc["N_NATIONKEY"]: doc for doc in mongodb_db['nation'].find({}, {"_id": 0})}

# Fetch documents from 'region' collection and find the EUROPE region key
europe_key = mongodb_db['region'].find_one({"R_NAME": "EUROPE"}, {"_id": 0})['R_REGIONKEY']
european_nations = [key for key, val in nations.items() if val['N_REGIONKEY'] == europe_key]

# Combine and filter the results
combined_results = []
for part in brass_parts:
    for supplier, _, _, nation_key, _, acctbal, address, phone, comment, partkey, supplycost in suppliers_partsupps:
        if nation_key in european_nations and partkey == part['P_PARTKEY']:
            combined_results.append((acctbal, nations[nation_key]['N_NAME'], supplier, partkey, part['P_MFGR'], address, phone, comment))

# Sort the results according to the given sorting order
combined_results.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1], x[2], x[3]))

# Write output to query_output.csv file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['S_ACCTBAL', 'N_NAME', 'S_NAME', 'P_PARTKEY', 'P_MFGR', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE', 'S_COMMENT'])
    for line in combined_results:
        writer.writerow(line)

# Close the MySQL connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
```

Please save the above code into a file named `query.py`. Now, here's the Bash script for installing the required dependencies to run that Python code:

```bash
# install.sh

#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 & PIP if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please save the above script into a file named `install.sh` and don't forget to give it execute permissions with `chmod +x install.sh` before running it.
