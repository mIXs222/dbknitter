This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

**Bash Script (`setup.sh`):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure pip is installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please note that you'll have to adjust the `.sh` script if you are not using a Debian-based Linux distribution, as `apt-get` is a package manager specific to such distributions. Also, in Redis, it's assumed that `direct_redis` provides a pandas DataFrame-compatible `get` method, as it is not a standard Redis library function. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual `direct_redis` library's functionality.
