This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the Python code that would execute the described query by getting data from different databases:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                                   user='root',
                                   password='my-secret-pw',
                                   db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_connection.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_collection = mongo_db['customer']

# Create function to get distinct customer counts from MySQL
def get_order_counts():
    query = """
    SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*)
    FROM orders
    WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS NOT IN ('pending', 'deposits')
    GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY;
    """
    mysql_cursor.execute(query)
    return dict(mysql_cursor.fetchall())

# Get the customers with their order counts
order_counts = get_order_counts()

# Create a dictionary to store distribution of customers by number of orders
distribution = {}

# Initialize distribution with customers from MongoDB with zero orders
for customer in mongo_collection.find({}, {'C_CUSTKEY': 1}):
    custkey = customer['C_CUSTKEY']
    distribution[custkey] = distribution.get(custkey, 0)

# Update distribution with order counts
for custkey, count in order_counts.items():
    distribution[custkey] = count

# Count the distribution
final_distribution = {}
for count in distribution.values():
    final_distribution[count] = final_distribution.get(count, 0) + 1

# Write the query result to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['Number of Orders', 'Number of Customers'])
    for orders, customers in sorted(final_distribution.items()):
        writer.writerow([orders, customers])

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_connection.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here's a Bash script that would install all dependencies needed to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
