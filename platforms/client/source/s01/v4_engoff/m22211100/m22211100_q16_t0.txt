It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (named `execute_query.py`) you requested to execute the described query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Getting data from MongoDB
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.supplier.find(
    {}, {"_id": 0, "S_SUPPKEY": 1, "S_COMMENT": 1})))

partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.partsupp.find(
    {}, {"_id": 0, "PS_SUPPKEY": 1, "PS_PARTKEY": 1})))

# Filter out suppliers with complaints from 'S_COMMENT'.
supplier_df = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Redis connection and data retrieval
import direct_redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)
part_df = pd.read_json(r.get('part'), orient='records')

# Filtering part dataframe based on conditions
filtered_part_df = part_df[
    (part_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9])) &
    (~part_df['P_TYPE'].str.contains('MEDIUM POLISHED')) &
    (part_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45')
]

# Combine parts from Redis with partsupp and supplier from MongoDB
combined_df = filtered_part_df.merge(partsupp_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')
combined_df = combined_df.merge(supplier_df, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Make the final result
result = combined_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).agg({'S_SUPPKEY': 'count'}).reset_index()
result.rename(columns={'S_SUPPKEY': 'supplier_count'}, inplace=True)

# Sort the result
result.sort_values(by=['supplier_count', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True], inplace=True)

# Write result to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next, here is the corresponding bash script (named `install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python MongoDB client, direct_redis and pandas
pip3 install pymongo pandas

# Install the redis package for direct_redis
apt-get install -y redis

# direct_redis does not seem to be a standard Python package. The script assumes
# it is available. If this is a custom library, it would need to be installed manually
# or by specifying the exact location where it can be installed from.
# Since it's not a standard package, I'm commenting it out.
# pip3 install direct_redis
```
Please note that you might need to adjust the `install_dependencies.sh` script as I've made assumptions about your system, and as direct_redis is not a known standard Python package, you'll need to provide the source for it. The 'direct_redis' package and the proposed usage (`direct_redis.DirectRedis`) are not found in any known repositories. If it is a proprietary or custom package, you'd need to include its installation in the script.
