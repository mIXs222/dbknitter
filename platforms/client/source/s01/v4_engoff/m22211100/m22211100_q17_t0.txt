This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments., The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a brand 23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code to execute the query (`query_code.py`):
```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# MySQL query to get necessary data from the lineitem table
lineitem_query = """SELECT L_PARTKEY, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE 
                    FROM lineitem
                """
lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(lineitem_query, mysql_connection)
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Getting part data from Redis and transform to Dataframe
part_data = redis_connection.get('part')
part_df = pd.read_json(part_data)

# Filter to get parts of brand 'Brand#23' with 'MED BAG'
filtered_parts = part_df.loc[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

# Join the two datasets on part key
merged_df = pd.merge(filtered_parts, lineitem_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the average quantity of orders
average_quantity = merged_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()

# Calculate the threshold for the small quantity
small_quantity_threshold = 0.20 * average_quantity

# Find orders with small quantities
small_quantity_orders = merged_df[merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] < small_quantity_threshold]

# Calculate the average yearly gross loss
average_yearly_loss = small_quantity_orders['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum() / 7

# Write output to a csv file
output = pd.DataFrame(data={'Average_Yearly_Loss': [average_yearly_loss]})
output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

2. Bash script to install all dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package repository
apt-get update -y

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install python3 -y
apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
