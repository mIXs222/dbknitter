**Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade existing packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install python3 and pip if not available
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pandas, pymysql, and redis-py
pip3 install pandas pymysql redis

# Install direct_redis (assuming it's available on PyPi)
pip3 install direct_redis
```

To run the bash script, you may need to make it executable first using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`. Then you can run it with `./install_dependencies.sh`. After the dependencies are installed, you can run the python code with `python3 query.py`.
