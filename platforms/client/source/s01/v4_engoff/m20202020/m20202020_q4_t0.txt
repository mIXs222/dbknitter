response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# import statements
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql', 
    user='root', 
    password='my-secret-pw', 
    database='tpch'
)

# Redis connection setup
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query lineitem from mysql
mysql_query = """
SELECT L_ORDERKEY FROM lineitem 
WHERE L_RECEIPTDATE > L_COMMITDATE 
AND L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1993-07-01' AND '1993-10-01';
"""

# Execute mysql query
lineitem_df = pd.read_sql_query(mysql_query, mysql_connection)
mysql_connection.close()

# Get orders from Redis as DataFrame
orders_data = redis_connection.get('orders')
orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_data, orient='records')

# Merge two datasets to find matching orders
merged_df = pd.merge(orders_df, lineitem_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY', how='inner')

# Aggregating the count of such orders for each order priority
result_df = merged_df.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY').size().reset_index(name='order_count')

# Sort the result by order priority
sorted_result_df = result_df.sort_values('O_ORDERPRIORITY')

# Write the output to a csv file
sorted_result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, for the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python libraries required for the script
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
```

Please note that `direct-redis` might not be a real library, and the `DirectRedis` client code is not standard, so you will need to replace it with the actual code needed to interface with Redis. Redis normally does not support complex queries or storing tables as in SQL-based databases, so the instructions might refer to a custom implementation which would need to be provided. However, assuming that a `get('tablename')` method exists and returns a DataFrame-compatible JSON string, the Python code should work as expected.
