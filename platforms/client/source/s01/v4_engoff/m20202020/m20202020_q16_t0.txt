It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the given query on your original data:

```python
# python_code.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connection information for MySQL and Redis
mysql_connection_info = {
    "host": "mysql",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "db": "tpch",
}

# Connect to MySQL
connection = pymysql.connect(**mysql_connection_info)
try:
    # Fetch suppliers from MySQL
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM supplier WHERE S_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%%Customer%%Complaints%%'")
        suppliers = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=["S_SUPPKEY", "S_NAME", "S_ADDRESS", "S_NATIONKEY", "S_PHONE", "S_ACCTBAL", "S_COMMENT"])

finally:
    connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection_info = {
    "host": "redis",
    "port": 6379,
    "db": 0,
}
redis_client = DirectRedis(**redis_connection_info)

# Fetch parts and partsupp from Redis
parts_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('part'), orient='records')
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('partsupp'), orient='records')

# Filter parts by specified attributes and prepare the size set
sizes = {49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9}
filtered_parts = parts_df[
    (parts_df['P_SIZE'].isin(sizes)) &
    (parts_df['P_TYPE'] != 'MEDIUM POLISHED') &
    (parts_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45')
]

# Merge parts with partsupp, and then merge with suppliers
merged_df = pd.merge(filtered_parts, partsupp_df, how='inner', left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, suppliers, how='inner', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Group by brand, type, and size, then count suppliers
grouped = merged_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], as_index=False).agg({'S_SUPPKEY': pd.Series.nunique})
grouped = grouped.rename(columns={'S_SUPPKEY': 'SUPPLIER_COUNT'})

# Sort the results
sorted_grouped = grouped.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_COUNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write out to 'query_output.csv'
sorted_grouped.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package index
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis

# Note: This bash script assumes it is being run on a Debian-based system like Ubuntu
