This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query_execution.py`) to execute the query on your original data. 

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

def connect_mysql(db_name, user, password, host):
    return pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, db=db_name)

def connect_redis(hostname, port, db):
    return direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=hostname, port=port, db=db)

def execute_query():
    # Connect to MySQL
    mysql_connection = connect_mysql('tpch', 'root', 'my-secret-pw', 'mysql')

    # Read customer data from MySQL
    with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT C_CUSTKEY FROM customer")
        customers = cursor.fetchall()
        
    # Map customers to their orders count
    customer_orders = {customer[0]: 0 for customer in customers}

    # Connect to Redis
    r = connect_redis('redis', 6379, 0)

    # Read orders data from Redis
    orders_df = pd.read_json(r.get('orders'))

    # Count orders for each customer
    for _, order in orders_df.iterrows():
        if order['O_ORDERSTATUS'] != "pending" and "deposits" not in order['O_COMMENT'].lower():
            if order['O_CUSTKEY'] in customer_orders:
                customer_orders[order['O_CUSTKEY']] += 1

    # Disconnect from databases
    mysql_connection.close()

    # Aggregate the results
    distribution_of_orders = pd.Series(customer_orders).value_counts().sort_index()

    # Write the output to query_output.csv
    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["number_of_orders", "number_of_customers"])
        for number_of_orders, number_of_customers in distribution_of_orders.items():
            writer.writerow([number_of_orders, number_of_customers])

execute_query()
```

Below is the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all the dependencies necessary to run the Python code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

pip install pymysql pandas direct-redis
```

Make sure the `install_dependencies.sh` script is executable before trying to run it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
