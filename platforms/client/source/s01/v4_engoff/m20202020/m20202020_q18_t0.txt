Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level., The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the customers who have ever placed quantity orders larger than 300. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def fetch_mysql_data():
    conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
    try:
        query = """
        SELECT
            c.C_NAME,
            c.C_CUSTKEY,
            l.L_ORDERKEY,
            SUM(l.L_QUANTITY) AS total_quantity
        FROM
            customer AS c
        JOIN
            lineitem AS l ON c.C_CUSTKEY = l.L_SUPPKEY
        GROUP BY
            c.C_CUSTKEY, l.L_ORDERKEY
        HAVING
            SUM(l.L_QUANTITY) > 300
        """
        return pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
    finally:
        conn.close()

def fetch_redis_data():
    redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    df_orders = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'), orient='records')
    return df_orders

def main():
    mysql_data = fetch_mysql_data()
    redis_data = fetch_redis_data()

    # Combine datasets from different databases using a left join on 'C_CUSTKEY' and 'L_ORDERKEY'
    result = pd.merge(mysql_data, redis_data, how='left', left_on=['C_CUSTKEY', 'L_ORDERKEY'], right_on=['O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY'])

    # Select the required columns
    result = result[['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'L_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'total_quantity']]

    # Write the result to the file
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Please note that the above code assumes that the `DirectRedis` client behaves similarly to the `redis.Redis` client in terms of fetching and decoding data. Make sure to adjust the code if necessary based on the actual behavior of the library you are using.
