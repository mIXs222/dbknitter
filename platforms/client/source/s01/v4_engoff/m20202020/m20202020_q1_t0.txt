The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you requested, which executes the query on your MySQL database:

```python
# query_mysql.py
import pymysql
import csv

# Establishing connection to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch',
                             charset='utf8mb4',
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor)

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # SQL query
        sql_query = """
        SELECT
            L_RETURNFLAG,
            L_LINESTATUS,
            SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
            AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
            AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
            AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
            COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
        FROM
            lineitem
        WHERE
            L_SHIPDATE < '1998-09-02'
        GROUP BY L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS
        ORDER BY L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS;
        """

        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write query result to CSV
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            writer.writerow(["RETURNFLAG", "LINESTATUS", "SUM_QTY", "SUM_BASE_PRICE", "SUM_DISC_PRICE", "SUM_CHARGE", "AVG_QTY", "AVG_PRICE", "AVG_DISC", "COUNT_ORDER"])
            for row in result:
                writer.writerow(row)
finally:
    connection.close()
```

And here is the corresponding bash script to install the dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh
python -m pip install pymysql
```

Make sure to give the script execution permissions and then you can run it before the Python script:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
python query_mysql.py
```
