It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    query = """
    SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_COMMENT
    FROM customer 
    WHERE C_ACCTBAL > 0.00 AND SUBSTRING(C_PHONE, 1, 2) IN ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21');
    """
    cursor.execute(query)
    customers = cursor.fetchall()

# Process customer data
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(customers, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 'C_NATIONKEY', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'C_COMMENT'])

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders_df_raw = redis_conn.get('orders')
orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_df_raw)

# Process orders data by filtering orders that are not older than 7 years
seven_years_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)).date()
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
recent_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] >= seven_years_ago]

# Merge customer data with recent orders to find customers who have not placed orders in the last 7 years
result_df = pd.merge(customer_df, recent_orders_df, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
result_df = result_df[result_df['O_ORDERDATE'].isna()].drop(columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERSTATUS', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'O_CLERK', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'O_COMMENT'])
result_df = result_df.groupby(['C_NATIONKEY']).agg({'C_CUSTKEY': 'count', 'C_ACCTBAL': 'mean'}).reset_index()
result_df.columns = ['C_NATIONKEY', 'CUSTOMER_COUNT', 'AVG_ACCTBAL']

# Output results to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next, here's the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pandas
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# Assuming direct_redis is a custom library, you might need to install it in a different way
# If direct_redis is a package available on PyPI, you could uncomment the following line:
#pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please make sure that you have appropriate permissions to execute the bash script and also make sure whether `direct_redis` can be installed via pip or it's a custom library. If it's a custom library you will need to install it manually or adjust the script accordingly.
