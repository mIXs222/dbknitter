The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue, customer key, customer name and customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems., \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query on the original data:

```python

# Execute the MySQL query and get the data

# Write the result to a CSV file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here's the bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python if not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3

# Install pip if not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python MySQL client
pip3 install pymysql

# Install Pandas library
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis library
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Make sure you have execution permission on the bash script. Use the command `chmod +x script_name.sh` to grant execution permission if needed.
