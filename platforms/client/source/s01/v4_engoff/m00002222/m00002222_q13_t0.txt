This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the Python code (query_redis.py) that you can use to execute the required query.
```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Create a connection to Redis
redis_hostname = 'redis'
redis_port = 6379
redis_db = 0
redis_client = DirectRedis(host=redis_hostname, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)

# Retrieve data from Redis
customer_data = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('customer'), orient='records')
orders_data = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'), orient='records')

# Perform the analysis
# Filter out orders that have pending status or contain 'pending' or 'deposits' in the comment
orders_filtered = orders_data[
    ~orders_data['O_ORDERSTATUS'].isin(['pending', 'deposits']) &
    ~orders_data['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', case=False, na=False)
]

# Merge the customer data with the filtered orders data
customer_orders = customer_data.merge(
    orders_filtered.groupby('O_CUSTKEY').size().reset_index(name='order_count'),
    how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY'
)

# Fill NaN values in the order_count column with 0 to indicate no orders for certain customers
customer_orders['order_count'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Calculate the distribution of customers by the number of orders
customer_distribution = customer_orders.groupby('order_count').size().reset_index(name='customer_count')

# Write the result to a CSV file
customer_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install dependencies:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Install Python Pandas and direct-redis

# First, make sure pip is installed
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Now install Pandas
python3 -m pip install pandas

# Install direct_redis
python3 -m pip install direct-redis
