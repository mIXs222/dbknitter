The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Next is the bash script that you requested to install all dependencies (this should be saved as a `.sh` file):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Upgrade existing packages
apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Ensure you have the correct permissions to run this script by using the command `chmod +x [script_name].sh`. Then execute the bash script to install the necessary dependencies to run the Python code.
