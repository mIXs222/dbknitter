It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL connection parameters
mysql_conn_params = {
    "host": "mysql",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "db": "tpch",
}

# Connect to MySQL and get parts that match the criteria
conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_params)
query_mysql = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_TYPE, P_SIZE
FROM part
WHERE P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45' AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%' AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
"""
parts = pd.read_sql(query_mysql, conn)
conn.close()

# Redis connection parameters
redis_conn_params = {
    "host": "redis",
    "port": 6379,
    "db": 0,
}

# Connect to Redis and get suppliers and partsupp
redis_db = DirectRedis(**redis_conn_params)
supplier_df = pd.read_json(redis_db.get('supplier'))
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(redis_db.get('partsupp'))

# Filter suppliers with no complaints and merge with partsupp
filtered_suppliers = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]
supp_partsupp = pd.merge(filtered_suppliers, partsupp_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='PS_SUPPKEY')

# Merge with the parts from MySQL to get the final result
final_df = pd.merge(supp_partsupp, parts, left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Group by P_TYPE, P_SIZE and count distinct suppliers
result = final_df.groupby(['P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])['S_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index()
result.rename(columns={'S_SUPPKEY': 'SupplierCount'}, inplace=True)

# Sort the results as required and save to CSV
result.sort_values(['SupplierCount', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True], inplace=True)
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script for installing the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python library dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct_redis
