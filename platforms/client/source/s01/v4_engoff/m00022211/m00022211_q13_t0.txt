This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here's the requested Python code (`execute_query.py`):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Redis Connection
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from MongoDB
mongo_orders = list(mongo_orders_collection.find({}, 
                      {'_id': 0, 'O_ORDERKEY': 1, 'O_CUSTKEY': 1, 'O_ORDERSTATUS': 1, 'O_COMMENT': 1}))
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(mongo_orders)

# Perform query for MongoDB data
orders_df = orders_df[~orders_df['O_ORDERSTATUS'].isin(['pending', 'deposits'])]
orders_df = orders_df[~orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', na=False)]

# Fetch data from Redis
customer_data = redis_client.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_json(customer_data)

# Perform a left join for combining the customer data with the orders data
combined_df = pd.merge(customer_df, orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left')

# Group the combined data by customer and count the number of orders
customer_order_count = combined_df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY')['O_ORDERKEY'].count().reset_index(name='order_count')

# Get the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made
customer_distribution = customer_order_count.groupby('order_count').size().reset_index(name='num_customers')

# Write results to CSV
customer_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here's the requested Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) for installing dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymongo direct_redis pandas
```

Make sure to give the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Then, you can run the bash script to install necessary dependencies before running the Python script:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
python3 execute_query.py
```
