This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the described query:

```python
# Python Code: execute_query.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connection details for MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connection details for MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]

# Prepare the output file
output_file = 'query_output.csv'

# Get the current date and calculate the date 7 years ago
current_date = datetime.now()
seven_years_ago = current_date - timedelta(days=7*365)

# Define the list of valid country codes
valid_codes = ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')

try:
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as mysql_cursor:
        # Query to select customers from MySQL whose phone starts with the valid country codes
        mysql_cursor.execute("""
            SELECT C_NATIONKEY, COUNT(*) AS customer_count, AVG(C_ACCTBAL) AS average_balance
            FROM customer
            WHERE C_PHONE LIKE '20%%' OR C_PHONE LIKE '40%%' OR
                  C_PHONE LIKE '22%%' OR C_PHONE LIKE '30%%' OR
                  C_PHONE LIKE '39%%' OR C_PHONE LIKE '42%%' OR
                  C_PHONE LIKE '21%%' AND
                  C_ACCTBAL > 0
            GROUP BY C_NATIONKEY
        """)
        mysql_result = {row['C_NATIONKEY']: {'customer_count': row['customer_count'], 'average_balance': row['average_balance']} for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()}

    # Query to select orders from MongoDB whose order date is less than 7 years ago
    mongo_collection = mongo_db['orders']
    mongo_result = mongo_collection.find(
        {
            'O_ORDERDATE': {'$lt': seven_years_ago.isoformat()}
        },
        {
            'O_CUSTKEY': 1
        }
    )
    # Convert the MongoDB result into a set of customer keys
    customers_with_recent_orders = set(doc['O_CUSTKEY'] for doc in mongo_result)

    # Open the output file for writing
    with open(output_file, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        # Write header
        writer.writerow(['C_NATIONKEY', 'CUSTOMER_COUNT', 'AVERAGE_BALANCE'])

        # Iterate over MySQL results and write rows for customers without recent orders
        for nation_key, data in mysql_result.items():
            if nation_key not in customers_with_recent_orders:
                writer.writerow([nation_key, data['customer_count'], data['average_balance']])

finally:
    mysql_conn.close()
    mongo_client.close()
```

Now, here is the Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash Script: install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and the pip package manager
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to give execute permissions to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
