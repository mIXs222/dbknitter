What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results).

response, 1. Here is the Python code to execute the given query (`query_script.py`):

```python

part_keys = []
for part in part_collection.find({"P_BRAND": "Brand#23", "P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG"}):

    writer.writerow(['avg_yearly_revenue_loss'])
    writer.writerow([avg_yearly_revenue_loss])

# Close the connections
mongo_client.close()
mysql_connection.close()
```

2. Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python libraries
pip3 install pymongo pymysql
```

Please note that this code assumes the presence of specific data and database structure as provided in your input. The logic implemented might need adjustments based on actual data, its distribution patterns, and business rules, which might not be perfectly translated from the given English query description.
