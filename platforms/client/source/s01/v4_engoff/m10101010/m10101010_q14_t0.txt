Here is the accompanying bash script to install all dependencies to run that Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update repositories and install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the bash script, and you may need to run it as a superuser to install packages system-wide. To do so, you might prefix the command with `sudo` when executing the script.
