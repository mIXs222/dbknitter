response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on your original data:

```python

import csv

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install pymongo
