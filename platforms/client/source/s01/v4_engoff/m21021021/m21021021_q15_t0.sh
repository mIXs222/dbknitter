# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and required dependencies for direct_redis
pip3 install pymongo pandas

# Assuming direct_redis comes with its own installation mechanism or is a custom package that's made available to the system
# git clone or wget direct_redis if it's available in a repository or some accessible location
# For example:
# git clone https://github.com/your-org/direct_redis.git
# cd direct_redis
# python3 setup.py install
# Alternatively, if direct_redis is a module that needs to be installed from a PyPI repository
pip3 install direct_redis

# Note: This bash script assumes 'apt-get' is present, which is typical for Debian/Ubuntu systems.
# For other distributions, the package manager (like yum, dnf, zypper) and package names might differ.
