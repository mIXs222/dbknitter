Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here's the Python code (query_executer.py) for your needs:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# Query for MongoDB to get lineitem data between the specified dates
start_date = datetime(1996, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(1996, 4, 1)
mongo_query = {
    "L_SHIPDATE": {
        "$gte": start_date,
        "$lt": end_date
    }
}
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find(mongo_query, {"_id": 0})))

# Connection to Redis
import direct_redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host="redis", port="6379", db=0)

# Query for Redis to get supplier data
supplier_df = pd.read_pickle(redis_client.get("supplier"))

# Combine data from MongoDB and Redis
combined_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, supplier_df, how='left', left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Calculate revenue
combined_df['REVENUE'] = combined_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - combined_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Find the top supplier(s)
top_revenue = combined_df.groupby(['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME'])['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()
top_revenue = top_revenue.sort_values(by=['REVENUE', 'S_SUPPKEY'], ascending=[False, True])
max_revenue = top_revenue['REVENUE'].max()
top_suppliers = top_revenue[top_revenue['REVENUE'] == max_revenue]

# Write result to CSV
top_suppliers.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here's the Bash script (setup.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and required dependencies for direct_redis
pip3 install pymongo pandas

# Assuming direct_redis comes with its own installation mechanism or is a custom package that's made available to the system
# git clone or wget direct_redis if it's available in a repository or some accessible location
# For example:
# git clone https://github.com/your-org/direct_redis.git
# cd direct_redis
# python3 setup.py install
# Alternatively, if direct_redis is a module that needs to be installed from a PyPI repository
pip3 install direct_redis

# Note: This bash script assumes 'apt-get' is present, which is typical for Debian/Ubuntu systems.
# For other distributions, the package manager (like yum, dnf, zypper) and package names might differ.
```

Please note that the above setup script assumes that `direct_redis` can be installed via `pip`. If `direct_redis` is a custom package or not available in PyPI, you'll need to adjust the installation process accordingly. Similarly, it assumes a Debian-based system for using `apt-get`. If that differs, you'll have to adjust the package manager commands as well.
