Please note that the code above assumes that the data from Redis is structured in such a way that it can be used with pandas, and that `specified_dim` will be replaced with the actual value as needed. As the database schemas are provided, the code attempts to replicate the logic of the provided query within the constraints of the different database systems being used.

Here is a Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash script to install Python dependencies

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pandas pymysql pymongo direct_redis
```

Please make sure to run the bash script with root privileges or add `sudo` before the `apt-get` commands if you are not running as a root user. Additionally, the required Python libraries can be installed in a virtual environment if you prefer to manage dependencies more neatly.
