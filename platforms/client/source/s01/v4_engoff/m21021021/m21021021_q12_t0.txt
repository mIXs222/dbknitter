The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode which is MAIL and SHIP, for lineitems actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`query.py`):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv
import datetime

# Connecting to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# Querying MongoDB for lineitem data
lineitem_query = {
    "L_SHIPMODE": {"$in": ["MAIL", "SHIP"]},
    "L_RECEIPTDATE": {"$gte": datetime.datetime(1994, 1, 1), "$lt": datetime.datetime(1995, 1, 1)},
    "L_SHIPDATE": {"$lt": "$L_COMMITDATE"}
}
lineitem_projection = {
    "_id": 0,
    "L_ORDERKEY": 1,
    "L_RECEIPTDATE": 1,
    "L_COMMITDATE": 1,
    "L_SHIPMODE": 1
}
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find(lineitem_query, lineitem_projection)))

# Connecting to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Querying Redis for orders data
orders_str = redis_client.get('orders')
orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_str)

# Merge lineitem and orders data
merged_df = lineitem_df.merge(orders_df, how='inner', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Determine late lineitems
merged_df['is_late'] = merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']

# Partition by priority
urgent_high_priority = merged_df[(merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == 'URGENT') | (merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == 'HIGH')]
other_priority = merged_df[(merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] != 'URGENT') & (merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] != 'HIGH')]

# Count late lineitems by shipmode and priority
result_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Ship_Mode': ['MAIL', 'SHIP'],
    'URGENT/HIGH_Priority_Late': [
        urgent_high_priority[urgent_high_priority['L_SHIPMODE'] == 'MAIL']['is_late'].sum(),
        urgent_high_priority[urgent_high_priority['L_SHIPMODE'] == 'SHIP']['is_late'].sum(),
    ],

    ]
})

# Write the result to a csv file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script (`setup.sh`) that installs all dependencies required to execute the Python code provided:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and Pip if they aren't already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MongoDB driver and Redis client for Python
pip3 install pymongo direct_redis pandas
```

Make sure to give the bash script (`setup.sh`) execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

To run the bash script, you would execute:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

Afterwards, run the Python script:
```bash
python3 query.py
```
