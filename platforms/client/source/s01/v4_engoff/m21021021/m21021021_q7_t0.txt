Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

Part 2: The Bash script (install_dependencies.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade packages
apt-get update
apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python and Pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Please remember that you should have appropriate permissions to execute the bash script. Also, ensure that Python and pip are installed and accessible as `python3` and `pip3`, respectively. If you're using environments like conda, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.
