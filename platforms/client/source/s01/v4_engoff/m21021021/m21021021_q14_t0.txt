The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is your requested Python code:

```python

# Constants
MYSQL_HOST = 'mysql'
MYSQL_DB = 'tpch'
MYSQL_USER = 'root'
MYSQL_PASSWORD = 'my-secret-pw'

MONGO_HOST = 'mongodb'
MONGO_PORT = 27017
MONGO_DB = 'tpch'

# Date range for the query
DATE_FORMAT = "%Y-%m-%d"
START_DATE = datetime.strptime("1995-09-01", DATE_FORMAT)
END_DATE = datetime.strptime("1995-10-01", DATE_FORMAT)

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host=MYSQL_HOST, user=MYSQL_USER, password=MYSQL_PASSWORD, db=MYSQL_DB)
mysql_cursor = mysql_connection.cursor()

# Query to select all parts that are considered promotional
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part WHERE P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%'")
promotional_parts = set(row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall())

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(MONGO_HOST, MONGO_PORT)

            'L_PARTKEY': {'$in': list(promotional_parts)}
        }

with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:

    writer.writerow(['total_revenue'])
    writer.writerow([total_revenue])

# Close connections

```

And here is the bash script to install the required dependencies to run the provided Python code (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
pip install pymongo
```

Please note that Python scripts are generally run using `python` (or `python3` for Python 3.x) and not with bash directly. Also ensure these scripts have execution permissions (`chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` and `chmod +x query.py`) before running them.
