This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code that satisfies the requirements:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Establish MySQL connection
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Define the list of country codes
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
seven_years_ago = pd.Timestamp.now() - pd.DateOffset(years=7)

# Fetch customers data from MySQL
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL
        FROM customer
        WHERE LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) IN ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
        AND C_ACCTBAL > 0.00
    """)
    customers_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert to DataFrame
customers_df = pd.DataFrame(customers_data, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL'])

# Filter customers with account balance greater than 0
filtered_customers_df = customers_df[customers_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0]

# Setup Redis connection
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get orders data from Redis
orders_data = r.get('orders')
orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_data)

# Filter out orders within the last 7 years
filtered_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] <= seven_years_ago.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')]

# Identify customers who have NOT placed orders for 7 years
customers_no_recent_orders = set(filtered_customers_df['C_CUSTKEY']).difference(set(filtered_orders_df['O_CUSTKEY']))

# Filter customer DataFrame for those customers
output_df = filtered_customers_df[filtered_customers_df['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(customers_no_recent_orders)]

# Summarize the result
result = output_df.groupby(output_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2]).agg({
    'C_CUSTKEY': 'count',
    'C_ACCTBAL': 'mean'
}).rename(columns={'C_CUSTKEY': 'CustomerCount', 'C_ACCTBAL': 'AverageAccountBalance'})

# Write the result to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv')

# Close connections
mysql_connection.close()
```

And here is the associated Bash script to install dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install python3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
```

Please save each block of code to a file with the respective filenames indicated in the comments (query.py for Python code and install_dependencies.sh for Bash script) and give execution permission to the Bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
