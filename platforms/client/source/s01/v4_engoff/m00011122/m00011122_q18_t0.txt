Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level., The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the customers who have ever placed quantity orders larger than 300. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code (query_code.py):
```python
import pymongo
import redis
import pandas as pd

# MongoDB connection and query
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
customer_table = mongodb['customer']
customers = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_table.find({}, {
    "C_CUSTKEY": 1,
    "C_NAME": 1,
    "_id": 0
})))

# Redis connection and query
class DirectRedis(redis.Redis):
    def get(self, name):
        value = super().get(name)
        if value is not None:
            return pd.read_msgpack(value)

redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders = redis_client.get('orders')
lineitem = redis_client.get('lineitem')

# Filter for lineitem with quantity larger than 300
large_lineitem = lineitem[lineitem['L_QUANTITY'] > 300]

# Join operations
large_orders = orders.merge(large_lineitem, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')
large_order_customers = large_orders.merge(customers, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Select required fields
result = large_order_customers[['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'L_QUANTITY']]

# Write the result to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python packages
pip3 install pymongo==3.12.3 redis==4.1.1 pandas==1.3.5

# Note: Versions are based on the knowledge cut-off. If new versions are available, please update accordingly.
```
Please adjust the versions of the Python packages in the bash script according to the versions compatible with your environment and available at the time of deployment.
