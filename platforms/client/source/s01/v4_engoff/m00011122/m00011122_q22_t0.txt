This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that executes the multi-database query:

```python
# global_sales_opportunity_query.py

import pandas as pd
import pymongo
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# MongoDB connection and querying
def get_mongodb_customers(mongodb_host, mongodb_port, db_name):
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongodb_host, mongodb_port)
    db = client[db_name]
    customer_data = list(db.customer.find({}, {'_id': 0}))
    return pd.DataFrame(customer_data)

# Redis connection and querying
def get_redis_orders(redis_host, redis_port, db_name):
    redis_client = DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=db_name)
    orders_data = redis_client.get('orders')
    return pd.DataFrame(orders_data)

# Define the country code and date cutoff for the customers
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
date_cutoff = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Get data from MongoDB and Redis
mongo_customers = get_mongodb_customers('mongodb', 27017, 'tpch')
redis_orders = get_redis_orders('redis', 6379, 0)

# Filter customers based on conditions
filtered_customers = mongo_customers[
    mongo_customers.C_PHONE.str[:2].isin(country_codes) & 
    (mongo_customers.C_ACCTBAL > 0)
]

# Calculate the date cutoff for orders and filter orders without recent purchases
redis_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(redis_orders['O_ORDERDATE'])
filtered_orders = redis_orders[redis_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] >= date_cutoff]

# Find customers with no recent orders
customers_with_no_recent_orders = filtered_customers[
    ~filtered_customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(filtered_orders['O_CUSTKEY'])
]

# Group by country code and compute count and average balance
result = customers_with_no_recent_orders.groupby(
    customers_with_no_recent_orders.C_PHONE.str[:2]
).agg({'C_CUSTKEY': 'count', 'C_ACCTBAL': 'mean'}).reset_index()

result.columns = ['Country_Code', 'Customer_Count', 'Average_Balance']
# Save to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is the bash script for installing all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymongo redis pandas

# If direct_redis is not directly available, you might need to install from source or use an equivalent Redis client for pandas
# Assuming direct_redis is available through pip for this script, although it's not a standard package available on PyPI

pip3 install direct_redis

# Run the Python script to execute the query
python3 global_sales_opportunity_query.py
```

The instructions above assume that Unix `apt` package management is used (as in Ubuntu or Debian systems), pip is the package installer for Python, and that `direct_redis` is available through pip, which may not be the case. If `direct_redis` is not available from PyPI, alternative instructions are needed to install that package, such as from a GitHub repository or other sources. Additionally, in a real environment, you'll need to ensure that MongoDB and Redis are accessible with the provided hostnames and ports from the machine running the script.
