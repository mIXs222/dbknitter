This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Part 1: The Python code to execute the query on your original data.

```python
# python_code.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
customer_collection = mongodb['customer']

# Get customer data
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_collection.find({}, {"_id": 0})))

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get orders data from Redis and convert it to a DataFrame
orders_data_string = redis_client.get('orders')
orders_data = pd.read_json(orders_data_string, orient='records')

# Filter out "pending" or "deposits" orders from the orders data
orders_data_filtered = orders_data[~orders_data['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', na=False)]

# Count orders per customer
orders_per_customer = orders_data_filtered['O_CUSTKEY'].value_counts().reset_index()
orders_per_customer.columns = ['C_CUSTKEY', 'order_count']

# Merge customer data with order counts
merged_data = pd.merge(customer_data, orders_per_customer, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
merged_data['order_count'].fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Replace NaN with 0 for customers with no orders

# Count the distribution of customers by number of orders
customer_order_distribution = merged_data['order_count'].value_counts().sort_index().reset_index()
customer_order_distribution.columns = ['num_orders', 'num_customers']

# Write the results to a CSV file
customer_order_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Part 2: The Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip and Python dev tools
apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis

# Install direct_redis from the provided location
pip3 install git+https://github.com/myusername/direct_redis.git
```

Please note that in the bash script, I have assumed that `direct_redis` can be installed directly from a Git repository at `https://github.com/myusername/direct_redis.git`. Replace this URL with the actual URL from where `direct_redis` can be installed. If `direct_redis` is a custom package not available via pip or git, you would need to obtain the package and install it from the source or the provided files.
