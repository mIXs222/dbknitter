The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute your query:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py
from pymongo import MongoClient
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)

# MongoDB query to fetch promotional parts
parts_collection = mongo_db['part']
promotional_parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(parts_collection.find(
    {}, {'P_PARTKEY': 1, 'P_RETAILPRICE': 1, '_id': 0}
)))

# Redis query to fetch lineitem data
lineitem_df = redis_client.get('lineitem')
if lineitem_df:
    lineitem_df = pd.read_json(lineitem_df)

# Combine and process data
if lineitem_df is not None and not promotional_parts_df.empty:
    # Filter lineitem by shipdate
    lineitem_df = lineitem_df[(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1995-09-01') & (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1995-10-01')]

    # Merge to get only promotional parts
    merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, promotional_parts_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

    # Calculate revenue
    merged_df['revenue'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

    # Calculate the total revenue
    total_revenue = merged_df['revenue'].sum()

    # If total_revenue is not 0, calculate percentage, otherwise set percentage to 0
    promotional_revenue_percentage = (total_revenue / merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum() * 100) if total_revenue else 0

    # Write the result to csv file
    pd.DataFrame({'Promotion Effect Percentage': [promotional_revenue_percentage]}).to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not available
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MongoDB driver for Python
pip3 install pymongo

# We assume that you'll install 'direct_redis' manually as it's not a standard Python package
```

Please note that the `direct_redis` package is not standard and may not be installable via pip. If this is a custom package or module, you may need to obtain it from a specific source or it might require manual installation. The bash script assumes that the installation method for this package will be handled separately.
