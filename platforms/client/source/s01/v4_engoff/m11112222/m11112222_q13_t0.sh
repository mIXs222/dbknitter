# Assume that direct_redis comes from a private repository or internal library
# pip3 install direct_redis

# If direct_redis is not installable via pip, it might need to be added manually to the Python path,
# or the above Python code should be modified to work with the existing redis library:
# pip3 install redis

# If direct_redis is a local module, ensure that it is in the PYTHONPATH or the same directory as the query.py code.
