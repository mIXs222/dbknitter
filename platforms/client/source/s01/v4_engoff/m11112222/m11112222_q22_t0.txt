message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase. This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute your query:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def get_data_from_redis(table_name):
    direct_redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    table_data = direct_redis.get(table_name)
    if table_data is not None:
        df = pd.read_json(table_data)
    else:
        df = None
    return df

def query_global_sales_opportunity(customers, orders):
    # Filter for the required country codes in customer phone
    filtered_customers = customers[customers['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2).isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])]

    # Get customers who have not placed orders for the last 7 years
    current_year = pd.Timestamp('now').year
    seven_years_ago = current_year - 7
    customers_no_recent_orders = filtered_customers[~filtered_customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(orders['O_CUSTKEY'][orders['O_ORDERDATE'].dt.year > seven_years_ago])]

    # Calculate the average account balance greater than 0
    customers_positive_balance = customers_no_recent_orders[customers_no_recent_orders['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0]

    # Get the country code from the phone number
    customers_positive_balance['CountryCode'] = customers_positive_balance['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2)

    # Group by country code and evaluate count and average balance
    result = customers_positive_balance.groupby('CountryCode').agg(
        CustomerCount=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'), 
        AverageBalance=('C_ACCTBAL', 'mean')
    ).reset_index()
    
    # Write to csv file
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

def main():
    # Get data from Redis
    customers = get_data_from_redis('customer')
    orders = get_data_from_redis('orders')

    # Process the orders DataFrame
    orders['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders['O_ORDERDATE'])
    
    # Execute the query function
    query_global_sales_opportunity(customers, orders)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Below is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python if not installed (assuming Debian-based system)
# sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pandas, numpy, and redis-py-cluster (for direct_redis)
pip3 install pandas numpy redis-py-cluster
