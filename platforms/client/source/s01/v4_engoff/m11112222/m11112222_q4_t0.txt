message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders ordered between 1993-07-01 and 1993-10-01 in which at least one lineitem was received by the customer later than its committed date. The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code (`query.py`):
```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# Connection to the Redis database
connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve data from Redis
orders_df = pd.read_json(connection.get('orders'))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(connection.get('lineitem'))

# Merge DataFrames on the shared key
merged_df = orders_df.merge(lineitem_df, how='inner', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Filter by dates and check if the receive date is later than the commit date
filtered_df = merged_df[
    (merged_df['O_ORDERDATE'] >= '1993-07-01') & 
    (merged_df['O_ORDERDATE'] <= '1993-10-01') & 
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
]

# Count the number of such orders for each order priority
result_df = filtered_df.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY').size().reset_index(name='order_count')

# Sort the result by order priority
sorted_result_df = result_df.sort_values(by='O_ORDERPRIORITY')

# Write the output to the CSV file
sorted_result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
```

2. Bash script to install dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the repository and install pip if it is not installed.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip install pandas redis direct_redis
