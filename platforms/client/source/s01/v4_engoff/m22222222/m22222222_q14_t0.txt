message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: part, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- part: P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query monitors the market response to a promotion such as TV advertisements or a special campaign. The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, **1. The Python Code (`query_code.py`):**

```python
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd

# Connect to Redis instance
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
# Get data from Redis
part_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('part'), orient='records')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Process data according to the query
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1995-09-01') & (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1995-10-01')
]
merged_df = pd.merge(filtered_lineitem_df, part_df, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Check for promotional parts
# As there's no direct indication of what constitutes a promotional part in the provided schema,
# I'll assume parts with a special flag in P_COMMENT or P_NAME indicate a promotion.
# The below line is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual logic for identifying promotional parts.
merged_df['PROMOTIONAL'] = merged_df['P_COMMENT'].str.contains('promo') | merged_df['P_NAME'].str.contains('promo')

# Calculate total revenue and promotional revenue
total_revenue = merged_df['REVENUE'].sum()
promotional_revenue = merged_df[merged_df['PROMOTIONAL']]['REVENUE'].sum()
percentage_promotional_revenue = (promotional_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue > 0 else 0

# Output result
result = pd.DataFrame({
    'Total Revenue': [total_revenue],
    'Promotional Revenue': [promotional_revenue],
    'Percentage Promotional Revenue': [percentage_promotional_revenue]
})

result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
