message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get(\'tablename\')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def main():
    # Initialize connection to Redis
    redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

    # Read data from Redis into Pandas DataFrame
    df_customers = pd.read_msgpack(redis_conn.get('customer'))
    df_orders = pd.read_msgpack(redis_conn.get('orders'))

    # Filter out orders with statuses of "pending" or those including "deposits" in the comments
    df_orders_filtered = df_orders[~df_orders['O_ORDERSTATUS'].str.lower().str.contains('pending') & 
                                   ~df_orders['O_COMMENT'].str.lower().str.contains('deposits')]
    
    # Count the number of orders by each customer
    orders_count = df_orders_filtered.groupby('O_CUSTKEY')['O_ORDERKEY'].nunique().reset_index()
    orders_count.columns = ['C_CUSTKEY', 'TotalOrders']

    # Merge the customer list with the order counts
    df_result = pd.merge(df_customers, orders_count, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

    # Replace NaN in TotalOrders with 0
    df_result['TotalOrders'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

    # Count the distribution of number of orders by customers including those with zero orders
    order_distribution = df_result.groupby('TotalOrders').size().reset_index(name='CustomerCount')

    # Write the results to a CSV file
    order_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### 2. Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh) ###

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# First, make sure pip is installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct-redis which is a custom library and not available in the default pypi repository
pip3 install git+https://example.com/direct-redis.git
```

Please replace `https://example.com/direct-redis.git` with the actual Git repository URL where the `direct_redis` package is hosted, as the package doesn't seem to be a standard one available on PyPI.
