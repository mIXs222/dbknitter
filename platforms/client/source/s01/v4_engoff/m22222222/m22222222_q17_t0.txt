message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: part, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- part: P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\n This query determines how much average yearly revenue would be lost if orders were no longer filled for small quantities of certain parts. This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments., The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a brand 23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Below is the Python code (`query_exec.py`) you need to execute this query:

```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

def get_data_from_redis(redis_host, redis_port, db_name):
    client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=db_name)
    part_df = pd.read_json(client.get('part').decode('utf-8'))
    lineitem_df = pd.read_json(client.get('lineitem').decode('utf-8'))
    return part_df, lineitem_df

def calculate_lost_revenue(part_df, lineitem_df):
    # Filter parts that are of brand 'Brand#23' with 'MED BAG' container
    filtered_parts = part_df[(part_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (part_df['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]
    
    # Merge with lineitem table on part key
    merged_df = pd.merge(filtered_parts, lineitem_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')
    
    # Calculate the average quantity
    avg_quantity = merged_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()
    
    # Calculate yearly lost revenue
    small_quantity_orders = merged_df[merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] < 0.2 * avg_quantity]
    lost_revenue = small_quantity_orders['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum() / 7  # Assuming the 7-year database period
    
    return lost_revenue

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        # Config
        redis_host = 'redis'
        redis_port = 6379
        redis_db_name = 0

        # Fetch data from Redis
        part_df, lineitem_df = get_data_from_redis(redis_host, redis_port, redis_db_name)

        # Calculate the lost revenue
        avg_lost_revenue = calculate_lost_revenue(part_df, lineitem_df)

        # Write to CSV
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as file:
            file.write(f"Average yearly gross loss in revenue,{avg_lost_revenue}\n")
            
        print('Query executed successfully and output saved to "query_output.csv"')
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

And the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all required dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python3 if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Alternatively, ensure pip is installed regardless of Python version
# wget -qO- https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

# Install Pandas via pip for data manipulation
pip install pandas

# Install direct_redis via pip for connecting to Redis
pip install git+https://github.com/data-axle/direct_redis.git
```

Remember to make the Bash script executable and run it before executing the Python script:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Please note that the `direct_redis` library is fictional here and won't work without the actual implementation or equivalent. It's used in this example to satisfy the conditions of the query.
