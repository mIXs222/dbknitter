This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

2. Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure python3 and pip are installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the pandas library
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis (mock example, as direct_redis library does not exist in real)
# Here, one would normally install the actual library required to interface with Redis.
# We would define the dependency if it existed.
pip3 install direct-redis
