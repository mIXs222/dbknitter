The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here's the required Python code and the shell script to install all dependencies.
1. The Python code (query.py):
```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

def execute_query():
    # Connect to Redis
    r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    
    # Get all tables as Pandas DataFrames
    nation = pd.DataFrame(r.get('nation'))
    supplier = pd.DataFrame(r.get('supplier'))
    customer = pd.DataFrame(r.get('customer'))
    orders = pd.DataFrame(r.get('orders'))
    lineitem = pd.DataFrame(r.get('lineitem'))
    
    # Filter nations for 'INDIA' and 'JAPAN'
    nations_filtered = nation[nation['N_NAME'].isin(['INDIA', 'JAPAN'])]
    
    # Join supplier with nations_filtered to get suppliers from INDIA and JAPAN
    supplier_nation = supplier.merge(nations_filtered, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
    
    # Join customer with nations_filtered to get customers from INDIA and JAPAN
    customer_nation = customer.merge(nations_filtered, left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
    
    # Orders from the years 1995 and 1996
    orders_filtered = orders[(orders['O_ORDERDATE'] >= '1995-01-01') & (orders['O_ORDERDATE'] <= '1996-12-31')]
    
    # Join lineitem with orders_filtered
    lineitem_orders = lineitem.merge(orders_filtered, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')
    
    # Calculate the revenue
    lineitem_orders['revenue'] = lineitem_orders['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_orders['L_DISCOUNT'])
    
    # Join lineitem_orders with supplier_nation and customer_nation
    final_query = lineitem_orders.merge(supplier_nation, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
    final_query = final_query.merge(customer_nation, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
    
    # Filter for supplier and customer from different nations
    cross_nation_sales = final_query[(final_query['N_NAME_x'] != final_query['N_NAME_y']) &
                                     (final_query['N_NAME_x'].isin(['INDIA', 'JAPAN'])) &
                                     (final_query['N_NAME_y'].isin(['INDIA', 'JAPAN']))]
    
    # Extract year from date
    cross_nation_sales['year'] = pd.to_datetime(cross_nation_sales['O_ORDERDATE']).dt.year
    
    # Required columns for output
    result = cross_nation_sales.groupby(['N_NAME_x', 'N_NAME_y', 'year']).agg({'revenue': 'sum'}).reset_index()
    result = result.rename(columns={'N_NAME_x':'supplier_nation', 'N_NAME_y': 'customer_nation'})
    result = result.sort_values(by=['supplier_nation', 'customer_nation', 'year'])
    
    # Write to CSV
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute_query()
```

2. The bash script (install.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pandas
pip install direct-redis
```

To ensure the scripts work properly, you might need to add permissions to the bash script using `chmod +x install.sh` before execution. Also, note that the `direct_redis` package used in the Python code is fictional for this example, as querying Redis for Pandas DataFrames would typically require additional steps to translate data between Redis data types and Pandas DataFrames.
