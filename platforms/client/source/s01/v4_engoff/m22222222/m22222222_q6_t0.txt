The query lists the amount by which the total revenue would have increased if these discounts had been eliminated for lineitems with l_quantity less than 24. Note that the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code to execute the query on the Redis data.

```python
# forecast_revenue_change.py
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connection information
database_name = '0'
port = 6379
hostname = 'redis'

# Initialize DirectRedis connection
redis_client = DirectRedis(host=hostname, port=port, db=database_name)

# Retrieve 'lineitem' table from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Filter rows within the desired ship date, discount, and quantity
filtered_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= pd.Timestamp('1994-01-01')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < pd.Timestamp('1995-01-01')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'] >= (0.06 - 0.01)) &
    (lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'] <= (0.06 + 0.01)) &
    (lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] < 24)
]

# Calculate the potential revenue increase
filtered_df['POTENTIAL_REVENUE_INCREASE'] = filtered_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * filtered_df['L_DISCOUNT']

# Calculate the total amount by which revenue would have increased
total_potential_increase = filtered_df['POTENTIAL_REVENUE_INCREASE'].sum()

# Write to csv file
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'TOTAL_REVENUE_INCREASE': [total_potential_increase]})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, the bash script to install all dependencies necessary to run the Python code above.

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system and get required build tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python packages needed
pip3 install pandas redis direct_redis

# Set executable permissions for the script
chmod +x forecast_revenue_change.py

# Run the Python script to generate the query output
./forecast_revenue_change.py
``` 

Make sure you set the correct permissions for the bash script before running:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
