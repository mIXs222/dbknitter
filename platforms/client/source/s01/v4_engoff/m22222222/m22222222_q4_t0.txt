message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders ordered between 1993-07-01 and 1993-10-01 in which at least one lineitem was received by the customer later than its committed date. The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to Redis database
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read tables from Redis into Pandas DataFrames
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('orders'))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('lineitem'))

# Convert string dates to datetime objects
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'])

# Filter orders within the required date range

# Count such orders for each order priority
priority_counts = late_orders.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY')['O_ORDERKEY'].nunique().reset_index()

# Sort by priority (assuming the priorities are categorical with a known order)
# If the priorities are labeled numerically or alphabetically, we can sort directly.
# Here I'll assume they are labeled like "PRIORITY 1", "PRIORITY 2", etc.
priority_counts['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] = pd.Categorical(priority_counts['O_ORDERPRIORITY'],
                                                     categories=[f'PRIORITY {i}' for i in range(1, 6)],
                                                     ordered=True)

# Write result to query_output.csv
priority_counts_sorted.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Bash Script (`install_dependencies.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update system package index
apt-get update

# Install Python and Pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pandas redis direct-redis
```

Make sure to give execution permission to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
