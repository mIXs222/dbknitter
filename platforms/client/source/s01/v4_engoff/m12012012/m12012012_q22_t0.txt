This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose average account balance is greater than 0.00. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code that you can save as `query_code.py`. This code connects to both MySQL and MongoDB databases to execute the given query.

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Find all customers who have not placed orders for 7 years
seven_years_ago = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7*365)
ancient_orders = list(orders_collection.find({
    "O_ORDERDATE": {"$lt": seven_years_ago}
}, {"O_CUSTKEY": 1}))

ancient_custkeys = {order["O_CUSTKEY"] for order in ancient_orders}

# Construct the SQL query for MySQL
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
placeholders = ', '.join(['%s'] * len(country_codes))
query = f"""
SELECT LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) AS country_code, COUNT(*) AS num_customers, AVG(C_ACCTBAL) AS avg_balance
FROM customer
WHERE LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) IN ({placeholders})
AND C_ACCTBAL > 0
AND C_CUSTKEY NOT IN ({', '.join(['%s']*len(ancient_custkeys))})
GROUP BY LEFT(C_PHONE, 2)
"""

# Execute the query
mysql_cursor.execute(query, country_codes + list(ancient_custkeys))
results = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['country_code', 'num_customers', 'avg_balance'])
    for row in results:
        csvwriter.writerow(row)

# Close the connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

Here's a bash script to install all the dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
pip install pymongo
``` 

Make sure to provide execution permission to the bash script before running it:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
