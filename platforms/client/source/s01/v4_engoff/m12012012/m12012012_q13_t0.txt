This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is neither "pending" nor "depoists".\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query\'s output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database.'},2

response, Here is the Python code (query_execute.py):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Function to connect to MySQL and retrieve customers
def get_customers_from_mysql():
    connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            sql = "SELECT C_CUSTKEY FROM customer"
            cursor.execute(sql)
            customers = cursor.fetchall()
            return [c[0] for c in customers]
    finally:
        connection.close()

# Function to connect to MongoDB and retrieve orders
def get_orders_from_mongodb():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
    db = client["tpch"]
    
    orders = db.orders.find({"$and": [{"O_ORDERSTATUS": {"$nin": ["pending", "deposits"]}}, {"O_COMMENT": {"$not": {"$regex": "pending|deposits"}}}]})
    order_count_per_customer = {}
    
    for order in orders:
        cust_key = order["O_CUSTKEY"]
        order_count_per_customer[cust_key] = order_count_per_customer.get(cust_key, 0) + 1
        
    return order_count_per_customer

# Retrieve data from databases
mysql_customers = get_customers_from_mysql()
mongodb_orders = get_orders_from_mongodb()

# Combine and process the data
combined_data = {}

# Initialize all customers with zero orders
for customer_key in mysql_customers:
    combined_data[customer_key] = 0

# Update order counts for customers who have orders
for customer_key, order_count in mongodb_orders.items():
    combined_data[customer_key] = order_count

# Count the distribution
distribution = {}
for order_count in combined_data.values():
    distribution[order_count] = distribution.get(order_count, 0) + 1

# Output the data to the CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Number of Orders', 'Number of Customers'])
    for order_count, customer_count in sorted(distribution.items()):
        writer.writerow([order_count, customer_count])
```

And here is the bash script (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install python3-pip, python package manager
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
