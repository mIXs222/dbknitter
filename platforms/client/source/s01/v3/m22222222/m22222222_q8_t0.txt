response, I'm sorry but there seems to be a slight misunderstanding. Your data is stored in a Redis database while your users are writing queries as if the data is stored in a MySQL database. MySQL and Redis are two completely different types of databases, with the former being a relational database and the latter being a key-value store. Therefore, it's not straightforward to execute a MySQL query on a Redis database due to the incompatibility in their structures.

You may need to write custom code to replicate the SQL query's functionality, possibly by retrieving all data from the Redis database, converting it to a Pandas DataFrame, and then processing it. However, please note that this approach might not be efficient for large data. You may need to rethink your data strategy if such SQL-like operations are common.

For a Python script which accomplishes this, you would need to install 'redis', 'pandas' and 'numpy'. You would use redis to interact with your Redis database, pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical operations. This is a Python script on how you could potentially handle this problem.

Installation requirements bash script (install.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install redis pandas numpy
```

Python code (main.py):

```python
import redis
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#Initialize connection to Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from the Redis database
tables = ["nation", "region", "part", "supplier", "customer", "orders", "lineitem"]
df = {table: pd.read_msgpack(r.get(table)) for table in tables if r.exists(table)}

# merging dataframes
m1 = df['orders'].merge(df['lineitem'], how='inner', left_on = 'O_ORDERKEY', right_on = 'L_ORDERKEY')
m2 = m1.merge(df['customer'], how='inner', left_on = 'O_CUSTKEY', right_on = 'C_CUSTKEY')
m3 = m2.merge(df['nation'], how='inner', left_on = 'C_NATIONKEY', right_on = 'N_NATIONKEY')
m4 = m3.merge(df['region'], how='inner', left_on = 'N_REGIONKEY', right_on = 'R_REGIONKEY')
final_df = m4.merge(df['part'], how='inner', left_on = 'L_PARTKEY', right_on = 'P_PARTKEY')

# additional filtering
final_df = final_df[final_df['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA']
final_df = final_df[final_df['O_ORDERDATE'].between('1995-01-01', '1996-12-31')]
final_df = final_df[final_df['P_TYPE'] == 'SMALL PLATED COPPER']

# create volume and year fields
final_df['VOLUME'] = final_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - final_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
final_df['O_YEAR'] = final_df['O_ORDERDATE'].dt.strftime('%Y')

# grouping and aggregating data
grouped = final_df.groupby(['O_YEAR', 'N_NAME'])['VOLUME'].sum().reset_index()

# calculate MKT_SHARE
total_volume = grouped['VOLUME'].sum()
grouped['MKT_SHARE'] = grouped.apply(lambda row: row['VOLUME'] if row['N_NAME']=='INDIA' else 0, axis=1) / total_volume

result_df = grouped[['O_YEAR', 'MKT_SHARE']]

# Save to csv
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Execute this python code after running the install.sh file to install dependencies. Please note that optimizing such a query would ultimately depend on the size and nature of your data. 

If you keep having to accommodate for such queries in your use-case, consider switching to a database that supports SQL queries or having a SQL interface for your Redis database.
