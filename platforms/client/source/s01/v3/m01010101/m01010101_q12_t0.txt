response, To execute this task, a Python code can be written to pull data from two different databases MySQL and MongoDB, and manipulate that data to generate the desired output. The Python script (app.py) is as follows:

```python
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Database Connection

# MySQL
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_db.cursor()

# MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]

# Pull data

# MySQL data
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders")
mysql_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
mysql_df = pd.DataFrame(mysql_data, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERSTATUS', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'O_CLERK', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'O_COMMENT'])

# MongoDB data
mongo_data = list(mongo_db.lineitem.find())
mongo_df = pd.DataFrame(mongo_data)

# Merge MySQL and MongoDB data
merged_df = pd.merge(mysql_df, mongo_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Query manipulation

# Apply the conditions
filtered_df = merged_df[(merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) & (merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'] < merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE']) & (merged_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']) & (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') & (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] < '1995-01-01')]

# Add new columns
filtered_df['HIGH_LINE_COUNT'] = filtered_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x in ['1-URGENT','2-HIGH'] else 0)
filtered_df['LOW_LINE_COUNT'] = filtered_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].apply(lambda x: 0 if x in ['1-URGENT','2-HIGH'] else 1)

# Group by
grouped_df = filtered_df.groupby('L_SHIPMODE').sum()

# Order by
final_df = grouped_df[['HIGH_LINE_COUNT', 'LOW_LINE_COUNT']].sort_values(by='L_SHIPMODE')

# Output to CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```
To install the dependencies of this Python script, we need to install pandas, mysql.connector, and pymongo. All these can be done by creating a bash command file (install.sh) as follows:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pandas
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
python app.py
```
Once both these files are created, you can make the bash file executable using the 'chmod' command and then run it.

**Disclaimer:** The code provided here represents a general approach and might require adjustments to cater to specific conditions or requirements. It also aims to execute the query in sequence - first it gets the data from both databases, then manipulates that data in Python using pandas dataframe. It also assumes that 'O_ORDERKEY' and 'L_ORDERKEY' are unique identifiers that can be used to merge the data from both tables. However, this might not be the most efficient approach when dealing with large datasets. A more efficient approach may involve writing distributed join operations to combine these data at the database level.
