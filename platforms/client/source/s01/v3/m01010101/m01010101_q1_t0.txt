```

2. a bash command file (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.

```
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```
To run this bash command file, you may save it as "install.sh" and make it executable by running `chmod +x install.sh` in the terminal. You may then execute it by running `./install.sh`.

*NOTE:*
The above code will only work with MongoDB. Since you mentioned different platforms, if the platform is MySQL, then the above solution won't work, because MongoDB is NoSQL type Database, which follows a different structure than MySQL. You must decide exactly what databases you are going to use, and then include libraries and write code for them specifically.

You also need to aware that the conversion between MySQL query to MongoDB query is not 100% accurate. Because SQL and NoSQL have different conceptual models for how data should be stored and related. The MongoDB aggregation query used here could not exactly give the same results as one might expect from their SQL equivalent.
