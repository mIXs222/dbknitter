response, 1. Python Code (query.py)

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector
import pymongo

# Establish connection to MySQL
conn_mysql = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', database='tpch')

# Establish connection to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db_mongodb = client['tpch']

customers_mongo = db_mongodb.customer.find({})
orders_mysql = conn_mysql.cursor()

output = []

for customer in customers_mongo:
    if str(customer['C_PHONE'][:2]) in ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'] and customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0:
        order_exits = False
        orders_mysql.execute(f'SELECT * FROM orders WHERE O_CUSTKEY = {customer["C_CUSTKEY"]}')
        orders = orders_mysql.fetchall()
        if len(orders) > 0:
            order_exits = True

        if not order_exits:
            output.append([
                customer['C_PHONE'][:2],
                customer['C_ACCTBAL']
            ])

# Writing to file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(output)

# Close the connections
conn_mysql.close()
client.close()
```

2. Bash Command File (install_dependencies.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
```

Run the install_dependencies.sh file using the command below in the terminal.
```bash
bash install_dependencies.sh
```

Run the Python code using the command below in the terminal.
```bash
python3 query.py
```

Please note that while the provided script will get you started, handling the complex SQL logic in a MongoDB database would require more sophisticated querying and data processing. Some parts such as averaging or sorting may have to be done in your Python code after querying MongoDB. Also note that MongoDB doesn't have transactions natively like SQL databases do, so handling complex queries might lead to slower performance. A better approach might be using a data integration tool or ETL processes to get data from both sources into a single database or data warehouse, and then perform SQL queries on that.
