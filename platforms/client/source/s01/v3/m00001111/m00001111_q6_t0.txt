response, In order to communicate with MongoDB database from python, you need to use pymongo library. Here's a python code to execute your query:

Python code (code.py):

```python
import csv
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
database = client["tpch"]
lineitem = database["lineitem"]

pipeline = [
    {
        "$match": {
            "L_SHIPDATE": { "$gte": "1994-01-01", "$lt": "1995-01-01" },
            "L_DISCOUNT": { "$gte": .06 - 0.01, "$lte": .06 + 0.01 },
            "L_QUANTITY": { "$lt": 24 }
        }
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": None,
            "REVENUE": {"$sum": {"$multiply": ["$L_EXTENDEDPRICE", "$L_DISCOUNT"]}}
        }
    }
]

result = list(lineitem.aggregate(pipeline))

with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["REVENUE"])
    writer.writerow([result[0]["REVENUE"]])
```
In order to run this python code, pymongo library has to be installed in your python environment. Below is the bash command file to install all dependencies to run that python code:

Bash command file (dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pip install pymongo
```

To run the dependencies.sh script, make it executable using `chmod +x dependencies.sh` and then run it using `./dependencies.sh`. After that you can execute your python code using command `python code.py`.
