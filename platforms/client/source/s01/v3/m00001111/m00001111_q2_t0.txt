response, Generating the python code and bash command file can be tricky as we have to take into account the different data platforms. Also, we will have to separate the main SQL query into two parts: one to fetch data from MySQL and another to fetch data from MongoDB. Later, we will have to combine the results in python.

Here's a simplified representation:

1. Python Code (mysql_mongo_query.py):

```python
import mysql.connector
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password="my-secret-pw",
    database="tpch"
)

cursor = mysql_db.cursor()

# Execute first part of the query on MySQL
cursor.execute("""SELECT S_ACCTBAL, S_NAME, N_NAME, P_PARTKEY, P_MFGR, 
                  S_ADDRESS, S_PHONE, S_COMMENT
                  FROM part, supplier, nation,region
                  WHERE P_SIZE = 15 AND P_TYPE LIKE '%BRASS'
                  AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY
                  AND R_NAME = 'EUROPE'""")

mysql_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = mongo_client["tpch"]

# Execute second part of the query on MongoDB
partsupp_data = mongodb.partsupp.find()

# Combine two sets of data
combined_data = mysql_data + list(partsupp_data)

# Convert combined_data to pandas dataframe for saving it as CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(combined_data)
df.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

2. Bash Command File (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
pip install pandas
```

In order to use the install_dependencies.sh bash file, give it executable permissions with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` and then run it with `./install_dependencies.sh`.

Then, run the Python script with `python mysql_mongo_query.py`.

Note: The Python script is a basic template. It assumes that your MongoDB database does not require authentication. If it does, you'll need to add the username and password to the `MongoClient` URL. Also, it connects directly to the databases and retrieves data. It does not execute the subquery or ordering clause of the original SQL statement. This would need to be done using Python and pandas after retrieving the data.
