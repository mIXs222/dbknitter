response, 1. Here is a Python code that you need:

Python Script

```python
import mysql.connector
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# MySQL Setup
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password="my-secret-pw",
    database="tpch"
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_db.cursor()

# MongoDB setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]

# Retrieve data from MySQL and MongoDB
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM supplier, nation WHERE S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'")
mysql_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

mongo_data = mongo_db.partsupp.find()

# Merge MySQL and MongoDB data
data = []
for row in mysql_data:
    for doc in mongo_data:
        if row['S_SUPPKEY'] == doc['PS_SUPPKEY']:
            data.append({
                'PS_PARTKEY': doc['PS_PARTKEY'],
                'VALUE': doc['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * doc['PS_AVAILQTY']
            })

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Perform the query
result = df.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').sum().sort_values(by='VALUE', ascending=False)
threshold = df.VALUE.sum() * 0.0001
result = result[result.VALUE > threshold]

# Write the result to a csv file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

Please note that Python cannot perform SQL operations across different databases since it is out of SQL rule.

2. Here is a Bash command file to setup the environment:

Bash Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Install the necessary dependencies
pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo pandas
```

To execute the bash script, you would call:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

And to execute the python script, you would call:

```bash
python script.py
```
Please save the python script as script.py and the bash script as setup.sh, then execute the setup.sh in your command line to install the necessary python libraries and execute the script.py to obtain the result.
