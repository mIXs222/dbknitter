response, Creating an application that can talk to two databases, executing a combined query, and storing the results in a CSV file involves several steps. Here is a Python script, `query.py`, that is an example of how you might start this task.

### Python Code (`query.py`)

```python
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = MongoClient('mongodb:27017')
mongodb_database = mongodb_client['tpch']

# MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT
    N_NAME AS SUPP_NATION,
    S_ACCTBAL
FROM
    nation,
    supplier
WHERE
    S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
AND (N_NAME = 'JAPAN' OR N_NAME = 'INDIA')
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)
mysql_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Transfer MySQL data to a pandas DataFrame
mysql_df = pd.DataFrame(mysql_data, columns=['SUPP_NATION', 'S_ACCTBAL'])

# MongoDB query
mongo_data = mongodb_database.customer.find({
    'C_NATIONKEY': {'$in': ['JAPAN', 'INDIA']},
    'O_ORDERDATE': {'$gt': datetime(1995, 1, 1), '$lt': datetime(1996, 12, 31)}
}, {'C_NATIONKEY': 1, 'C_ACCTBAL': 1, '_id': 0})

# Transfer MongoDB data to a pandas DataFrame
mongo_df =  pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_data))

# Merge DataFrames
result = pd.merge(mysql_df, mongo_df, left_on='SUPP_NATION', right_on='C_NATIONKEY')

# Write to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Please note that the above Python script is highly simplified. Executing a real combined query on different databases in the given environment is a complex task and will require a much more comprehensive solution. 

### Dependencies Installation Bash script (`setup.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install mysql-connector-python pymysql pandas
pip3 install pymongo
```

To run the bash script, you can run `bash ./setup.sh` in your terminal. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script. 

Please note that you need to have Python3 installed before running the bash script. If you don't have Python pre-installed, consider adding `apt-get install -y python3` to the bash script. 

Remember to chmod the bash script to make it executable by using `chmod +x setup.sh` before running it.
