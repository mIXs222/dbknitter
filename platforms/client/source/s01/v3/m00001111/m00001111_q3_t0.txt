response, To execute the query, you can use the pandas and pymongo libraries to load the data from your MongoDB database into the pandas dataframe. Since you are trying to run MySQL query against MongoDB data, pandasql library can be used to make SQL queries against pandas DataFrames. Here is the python code:

bash command python code (.py):
```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import pandasql as psql
from pymongo import MongoClient

# connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client.tpch

# load the collections into pandas DataFrame
customer = pd.DataFrame(list(db.customer.find()))
orders = pd.DataFrame(list(db.orders.find()))
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find()))

# drop the MongoDB specific _id column
customer.drop('_id', axis=1, inplace=True)
orders.drop('_id', axis=1, inplace=True)
lineitem.drop('_id', axis=1, inplace=True)

# MySQL Query 
sql_query = """
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY
FROM
    customer,
    orders,
    lineitem
WHERE
    C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'
    AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'
    AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY
    L_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY
ORDER BY
    REVENUE DESC,
    O_ORDERDATE"""

# execute the SQL query
query_output = psql.sqldf(sql_query)

# write out the output to a CSV file
query_output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

```

Bash commands to install the dependencies associated with the code (.sh):

```shell
#!/bin/bash
python -m pip install pymongo
python -m pip install pandas
python -m pip install pandasql
```

To run the commands, save Shell script to a file install_dependencies.sh and run it with bash:
```shell
bash install_dependencies.sh
```

Make sure you give appropriate permissions before executing the .sh file:
```shell
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Note: The Python code is assuming that the MongoDB is running on the same machine (localhost) as the Python code and is using the default port (27017) for MongoDB. If this is not the case, then you will need to adjust the MongoClient constructor parameters to point to your MongoDB instance.
