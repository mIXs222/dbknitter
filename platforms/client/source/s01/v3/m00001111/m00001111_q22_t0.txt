response, Here's the Python script to execute the query on your database. The code assumes that you've correctly installed and set up pymongo and mysql.connector on your operating system.

Python Code `query_processing.py`:

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient

#Define the MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']

#Define the MySQL connection
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='your_mysql_user', password='your_mysql_password',
                              host='your_mysql_host',
                              database='tpch')

#Define the MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT
    CNTRYCODE,
    COUNT(*) AS NUMCUST,
    SUM(C_ACCTBAL) AS TOTACCTBAL
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        SUBSTR(C_PHONE, 1 , 2) AS CNTRYCODE,
        C_ACCTBAL
    FROM
        customer
    WHERE
        SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN
        ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
    AND C_ACCTBAL > (
            SELECT
                AVG(C_ACCTBAL)
            FROM
                customer
            WHERE
                C_ACCTBAL > 0.00
            AND SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN
            ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            orders
        WHERE
            O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY
        )
    ) AS CUSTSALE
GROUP BY
    CNTRYCODE
ORDER BY
    CNTRYCODE"""

#Execute the MySQL query
cursor = cnx.cursor()
cursor.execute(mysql_query)

#Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])  # write headers
    writer.writerows(cursor.fetchall())                  # write data

cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

Bash Commands Installation Script `dependencies_installation.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#update packages
apt-get -y update

#set default MySQL password
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server

#install Python and required packages
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
pip3 install mysql-connector-python pymongo
```

To use these files, you'd open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing these scripts, and then execute the command:
```bash
sh dependencies_installation.sh
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies. 

Then to run the python script you can type the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python3 query_processing.py
```

Remember to set the MySQL connection details according to your configurations. If it's not on localhost you will need to provide the proper host name in the variable `your_mysql_host`. Replace `'your_mysql_user'` with your MySQL username and `'your_mysql_password'` with your MySQL password. Remember that your MySQL server needs to allow connections from wherever this script is running.
