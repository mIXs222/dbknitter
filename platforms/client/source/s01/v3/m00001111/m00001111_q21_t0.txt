response, Here is the python code to run the provided SQL query across different databases.

```Python
# Imports 
from pymongo import MongoClient
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# MySQL Connection
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password="my-secret-pw",
    database="tpch"
)

# MongoDB Connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = client["tpch"]

# Fetch data from SQL 
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM nation, supplier"
cursor = mysql_db.cursor()
cursor.execute(sql_query)
rows = cursor.fetchall()
mysql_data = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=[i[0] for i in cursor.description])

# Fetch data from MongoDB
orders_data = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.orders.find()))
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.lineitem.find()))

# Join all data
all_data = pd.concat([mysql_data, orders_data, lineitem_data], sort=False)

# Apply SQL Query
wanted_data = all_data.query("S_SUPPKEY == L1.L_SUPPKEY and O_ORDERKEY == L1.L_ORDERKEY and O_ORDERSTATUS == 'F' and L1.L_RECEIPTDATE > L1.L_COMMITDATE and S_NATIONKEY == N_NATIONKEY and N_NAME == 'SAUDI ARABIA'")

# Write to CSV
wanted_data.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Please note that the provided SQL query is complex and may not work as intended as is. The above Python code is attempting to recreate the query using Pandas DataFrame operations, which can handle basic SQL commands but may not perform complex operations such as subqueries or joins across databases in the exact same manner. 

Here is a .sh file that installs all dependencies for this Python script.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
pip install pandas
```

To execute the python script, save the python code in a file `query_across_databases.py` and run it in a terminal as follows:

```bash
python query_across_databases.py
```

To install dependencies, save the bash script as `dependencies.sh` and run it as follows:

```bash
sh dependencies.sh
```

Please note that these solutions are assuming that your environment is correctly set up to execute Python and pip commands. If not, you may require python and pip installation commands which are not included in the above bash script.
