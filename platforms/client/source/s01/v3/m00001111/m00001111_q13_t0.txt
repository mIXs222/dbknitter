response, Here is a Python script that you can use to execute algorithms on your data:

```python
import csv
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
from mysql.connector import connect, Error

# MongoDB Connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']
customer = db['customer']
orders = db['orders']

# Mysql Connection
try:
    with connect(
        host="localhost",
        user=input("Enter username: "),
        password=input("Enter password: "),
    ) as connection:
        print(connection)
except Error as e:
    print(e)

# Fetch data from MongoDB    
customer_data = customer.find()
orders_data = orders.find()

# Create data tables
customer_table = {c['C_CUSTKEY']: c for c in customer_data}
orders_table = {o['O_CUSTKEY']: o for o in orders_data if 'pending deposits' not in o['O_COMMENT']}

# Merge data
merged_data = []
for c_key, c_val in customer_table.items():
    if c_key in orders_table:
        merged_data.append({**c_val, **orders_table[o_key]})

# Generate output
output = []
for item in merged_data:
    output.append([item['C_CUSTKEY'], len([o for o in orders_table if o == item['C_CUSTKEY']])])

# Write to csv
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(output)
```

For your bash script to install the dependencies, use the following commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Installing dependencies..."
pip install pymongo
pip install mysql-connector-python
echo "All dependencies installed successfully."
```
Please replace "localhost", "username", and "password" in the MySQL connections code with your actual MySQL host, user, and password informations respectively. Make sure running the bash script for installing the dependencies before running python script.
