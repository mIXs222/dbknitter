response, Here, we are considering that the MongoDB has all the required tables as mentioned above because SQL query runs in MySQL was designed with that thought. We would be converting that SQL query to equivalent MongoDB commands and run them in python using pymongo.

Here are the steps we will take:
1. Connect to each database using respective libraries.
2. Implement the query function.
3. Save the output to a csv file.

#### Python Code (.py):

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

def query_db():
    global result
    # create mongodb client
    mongodb_client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
    db = mongodb_client["tpch"]

    # implement SQL query in mongodb
    pipeline = [
        {"$match": {"N_NAME": "GERMANY"}},
        {"$lookup":{
            "from": "supplier",
            "localField": "N_NATIONKEY",
            "foreignField": "S_NATIONKEY",
            "as": "supplier_info"}},
        {"$lookup":{
            "from": "partsupp",
            "localField": "supplier_info.S_SUPPKEY",
            "foreignField": "PS_SUPPKEY",
            "as": "partsupp_info"}},
        {"$unwind":"$partsupp_info"},
        {"$unwind":"$supplier_info"},
        {"$group":{
            "_id":"$partsupp_info.PS_PARTKEY",
            "value": {"$sum": {
                "$multiply": [ "$partsupp_info.PS_SUPPLYCOST", "$partsupp_info.PS_AVAILQTY" ]}}}},
        {"$match": {"value": {"$gt": {
            "$sum": {
            "$multiply": [ "$partsupp_info.PS_SUPPLYCOST", "$partsupp_info.PS_AVAILQTY" ] * 0.0001000000}}}}},
        {"$sort": {"value": -1}}
    ]

    result = list(db.nation.aggregate(pipeline))

def save_to_csv():
    # converting the output to pandas dataframe
    result_df = pd.DataFrame(result)
    # output the result to csv
    result_df.to_csv("./query_output.csv", index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query_db()
    save_to_csv()
```

#### Bash command file (.sh) to install dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Starting to install dependencies'
pip install pymongo pandas
echo 'Finished installing dependencies'
```

To run the shell script, you would have to give it execute permissions using the command `chmod +x script_name.sh` and then run it using `./script_name.sh`.

P.S: In the bash file, we are installing pymongo which is a MongoDB client for Python, and pandas which is a data manipulation tool in Python.
