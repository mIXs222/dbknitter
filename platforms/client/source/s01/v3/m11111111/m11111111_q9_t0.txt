response, Below are the Python and bash code for the problem.

1. The Python script:

```python
import csv
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
from datetime import datetime

# MongoDB setup
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['tpch']

# Tables
tables = ["nation", "part", "supplier", "partsupp", "orders", "lineitem"]

# Join the tables
records = []
for table in tables:
    if table in db.list_collection_names():
        records.extend(list(db[table].find()))

# Combine the data based on the conditions
result = []
for record in records:
    if 'S_SUPPKEY' in record and 'L_SUPPKEY' in record and 'PS_SUPPKEY' in record and 'PS_PARTKEY' in record and 'P_PARTKEY' in record and 'O_ORDERKEY' in record and 'S_NATIONKEY' in record and 'N_NATIONKEY' in record and 'P_NAME' in record and 'dim' in record['P_NAME']:
        amount = record['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - record['L_DISCOUNT']) - record['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * record['L_QUANTITY']
        result.append({
            'NATION': record['N_NAME'],
            'O_YEAR': datetime.strptime(record['O_ORDERDATE'], '%Y-%m-%d').year,
            'SUM_PROFIT': amount
        })

# Write the result to the csv file
keys = result[0].keys()
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as output_file:
    dict_writer = csv.DictWriter(output_file, keys)
    dict_writer.writeheader()
    dict_writer.writerows(result)
```

2. Bash script for dependencies installation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
sudo pip3 install pymongo
```

Save the bash script as `install_dependencies.sh`.

The Python script assumes that MongoDB is running on localhost and port 27017. The database 'tpch' and the required collections exist. Pymongo was already installed via pip.

The bash script is an executable shell script that installs Python 3 pip and pymongo Python library which is needed to connect to the MongoDB server.
