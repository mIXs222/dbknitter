response, To execute this, you'd have to adjust the logic of MySQL queries to MongoDB's JSON-like queries, because the nested subqueries aren't directly supported in MongoDB.

Here is python code of how the query might appear, however note that it might still require modifications to return exactly same result as above nested SQL query. 

Python code: isomorphism.py

```python
import csv
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')
db = client['tpch']
#
coll_list = ["part", "supplier", "partsupp", "nation", "region"]

results = []
for coll_name in coll_list: 
    if coll_name in db.list_collection_names():
        collection = db[coll_name]        
        if coll_name == "part":
            part_query = {"P_SIZE":15, "P_TYPE": {"$regex": ".*BRASS.*"}}
            parts = collection.find(part_query)
        elif coll_name == "supplier":
            supplier_query = {"S_NATIONKEY":{"$in": list_of_S_NATIONKEY} }
            suppliers = collection.find(supplier_query)
        elif coll_name == "partsupp":
            partsupp_query = 
            {"PS_PARTKEY":{"$in": list_of_P_PARTKEY}, "PS_SUPPKEY":{"$in": list_of_S_SUPPKEY}}
            partsupps = collection.find(partsupp_query)
        elif coll_name == "nation":
            nation_query = {"N_REGIONKEY": list_of_R_REGIONKEY}
            nations = collection.find(nation_query)
        elif coll_name == "region":
            region_query = {"R_NAME": "EUROPE"}
            regions = collection.find(region_query)

results = some_logic_to_combine_all_results(parts, suppliers, partsupps, nations, regions)

# Write results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(results)
```

Bash command to install dependencies: install.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo
pip install csv
```

To run the specific bash file you would use the command: 
```bash
sh install.sh
``` 

and to run the python script you would simply enter 
```bash
python isomorphism.py
``` 

Note: some revisions will need to be made for this code to run correctly, as it is not possible to execute SQL nested queries directly in MongoDB. 

Please execute both files at your local device. 

This is a rough solution and things can get very complex when trying to manually join collections in Python especially when we need to create multiple layers of subqueries. 

I would recommend to transpose all the data from MongoDB to MySQL and then execute the above nested SQL query, this way you'll get the data exactly. If that's not possible, then you will most likely have to use a combination of the aggregation framework, map reduce, python programming to get the equivalent result.
