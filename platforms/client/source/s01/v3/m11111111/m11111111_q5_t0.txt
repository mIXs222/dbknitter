response, You would need to transform the SQL query to MongoDB's format. Unfortunately, MongoDB does not support JOIN operations natively. 

The query you provided contains JOIN operations. You must either perform these operations within the application layer (i.e., in Python) or redesign your database to reduce or eliminate the need for JOIN operations.

Here's some python code to get the data separately:

```python
#python code to execute query(.py)
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')
db = client['tpch']

def get_data(collection):
  return pd.DataFrame(list(db[collection].find()))

dfs = {
    "nation": get_data('nation'),
    "region": get_data('region'),
    "supplier": get_data('supplier'),
    "customer": get_data('customer'),
    "orders": get_data('orders'),
    "lineitem": get_data('lineitem')
}

dfs['region'] = dfs['region'][dfs['region']['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA']
dfs['orders'] = dfs['orders'][dfs['orders']['O_ORDERDATE'].between('1990-01-01', '1995-01-01')]

# Proceed with pandas merge operations to simulate JOIN (left, right, inner, outer)
# df = dfs['customer'].merge(dfs[....

# ......More pandas manipulations to finish the query.

# And finally write to CSV
# final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

The equivalent shell script to install the necessary python packages:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Converting the whole SQL JOIN query to python pandas merges and conditions should be done carefully in order to ensure that the output is accurately representing the exact SQL query.
Please note that MongoDB might not be the best solution if you frequently need to perform JOIN operations. It's designed to work with denormalized data, and can be complex to work with data in a relational way. At least not as straightforward as with regular SQL databases.
