response, As the database is under mongodb, the task involves transforming sql to mongodb queries. 
Moreover, the transformation of SQL to mongodb syntax is more complex when MongoDB does not support JOIN directly and requires more data processing. Below are minimal bash commands and python scripts to connect to MongoDB.

# Python code to connect to MongoDB and perform the queries

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client['tpch']
customer = db['customer']
orders = db['orders']

# Aggregate command is used, which is similar to JOIN in SQL.
pipeline = [
    {"$lookup":
        {
        "from": "orders",
        "localField": "C_CUSTKEY",
        "foreignField": "O_CUSTKEY",
        "as": "customer_orders"
        }
    },
    {"$unwind": "$customer_orders"},
    {"$match": {"customer_orders.O_COMMENT": {"$not": {"$regex": "pending|deposits"}}}},
    {"$group": {"_id": "$C_CUSTKEY", "C_COUNT": {"$sum": 1}}},
    {"$group": {"_id": "$C_COUNT", "CUSTDIST": {"$sum": 1}}},
    {"$sort": {"CUSTDIST": -1, "_id": -1}}
]

result = list(db.customer.aggregate(pipeline))

# convert result to dataframe and write it to .csv
df = pd.DataFrame(result)
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

This python script can be put into a `.py` file (say `mongodb_query.py`) and be run in bash as `python mongodb_query.py`

# Bash script to install dependencies

You can write a bash script to install dependencies like `pymongo` and `pandas`. Here is the bash script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Put the bash commands into a `.sh` file (say `install.sh`) and run it using `bash install.sh`.

Please note that this solution is assuming MongoDB 3.2+ version (as `$lookup` pipeline was introduced in this version) and python 3 version.
