response, To solve your problem, as the data does not actually exist within a MySQL server, but from a MongoDB server, so the MySQL-related query and dependencies wouldn't be necessary as the data exists in MongoDB and queries should be written according to MongoDB's query syntax.

Here goes the python code:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['tpch']
collection = db['lineitem']

pipeline = [
    {"$match": { 
        "L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte": '1994-01-01', "$lt": '1995-01-01'},
        "L_DISCOUNT": {"$gte": .06 - 0.01, "$lte": .06 + 0.01},
        "L_QUANTITY": {"$lt": 24} 
    }}, 
    {"$project": {
        "REVENUE": {"$multiply": ["$L_EXTENDEDPRICE", "$L_DISCOUNT"]}
    }}, 
    {"$group": {
        "_id": None, 
        "REVENUE": {"$sum": "$REVENUE"}
    }}
]

result = collection.aggregate(pipeline)
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    fieldnames = ['REVENUE']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    for res in result:
        writer.writerow({"REVENUE": res["REVENUE"]})
```

For installing Python dependencies in bash script, see the following:

dependencies.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo
```

To run the bash script file use the following command:

`bash dependencies.sh`

Remember that pymongo requires python 2.7, 3.5+, not PyPy or Jython.
You can then run your python program with the following command:

`python your_program_name.py`
