response, Here is the Python script to execute the SQL query in MongoDB and save the results to a CSV file:

```bash command python code (.py)```
```python
import csv
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['tpch']

pipeline = [
    {
        "$lookup": {
            "from": "part",
            "localField": "L_PARTKEY",
            "foreignField": "P_PARTKEY",
            "as": "part_docs"
        }
    },
    {
        "$match": {
            "part_docs.P_BRAND": "Brand#23",
            "part_docs.P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG",
            "L_QUANTITY": {"$lt" : 0.2}
        }
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": "$L_PARTKEY",
            "avg_yearly": {"$avg": "$L_EXTENDEDPRICE"}
        }
    }
]

results = db['lineitem'].aggregate(pipeline)
avg_yearly_results = [{'_id': result['_id'], 'avg_yearly': result['avg_yearly'] / 7.0} for result in results]

with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=['_id', 'avg_yearly'])
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(avg_yearly_results)
```
This script first creates a pipeline for an aggregation query in MongoDB, which performs the same operations as in the given SQL query. Then, it executes the query, processes the results to calculate AVG_YEARLY, and writes the final results to the query_output.csv file.

To run this script, you will need to install the pymongo library, which is used to interact with MongoDB from Python.

```bash command file (.sh)```
```sh
#! /bin/bash
echo 'Installing dependencies...' 
pip install pymongo
echo 'Dependencies installed.'
python script.py
echo 'Script executed.'
```
This script will install the pymongo library and execute the Python script. You will need to replace 'script.py' with the actual name of your Python script. To run the bash script, use the command ` chmod +x script.sh ` to make it executable, then ` ./script.sh ` to execute the script.
Note that this is a basic script without error checking, and it assumes that you have Python and pip properly installed on your machine.
