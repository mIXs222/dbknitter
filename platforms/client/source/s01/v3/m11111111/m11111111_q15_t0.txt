response, Here is the python code to execute this query from two different data platforms and combine the results. 

But before doing so, you should know that MongoDB doesn't support direct SQL-like queries, so we need to formulate equivalent queries using PyMongo tool, after that we will be combining the results as per your requirement. 

1. Python Code (query.py):

```python
import csv
import pymongo
import mysql.connector
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to the MongoDB server and the required database
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]

# Get the MongoDB tables
lineitem = db["lineitem"]
supplier = db["supplier"]

# Retrieve and process the required data from MongoDB 
result = lineitem.aggregate([
    {
        "$match": {
            "L_SHIPDATE": {
                "$gte": datetime(1996, 1, 1),
                "$lt": datetime(1996, 4, 1)
            }
        }
    }, 
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": "$L_SUPPKEY",
            "TOTAL_REVENUE": {"$sum": {"$multiply": ["$L_EXTENDEDPRICE", {"$subtract": [1, "$L_DISCOUNT"]}]} }
        }
    }
])

mongodb_res = list(result)

# Get the MySQL database
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='password',
                              host='localhost',
                              database='tpch')

cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Formulate and run MySQL queries
query = ("SELECT S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_PHONE "
         "FROM supplier WHERE S_SUPPKEY = %s")

for res in mongodb_res:
    cursor.execute(query, (res["_id"], ))
    mysql_res = cursor.fetchall()

    res["S_SUPPKEY"] = mysql_res[0][0]
    res["S_NAME"] = mysql_res[0][1]
    res["S_ADDRESS"] = mysql_res[0][2]
    res["S_PHONE"] = mysql_res[0][3]

# Write the results to the CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["S_SUPPKEY", "S_NAME", "S_ADDRESS", "S_PHONE", "TOTAL_REVENUE"])
    for r in mongodb_res:
        writer.writerow([r["S_SUPPKEY"], r["S_NAME"], r["S_ADDRESS"], r["S_PHONE"], r["TOTAL_REVENUE"]])
```

To run this code you need to have pymongo and mysql.connector python libraries.

2. Bash Command File (install.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo mysql-connector-python
```

Please replace the placeholder such as 'localhost', 'root', 'password' with your actual database and user details. Also the date values could be adjusted to your need. Above script assumes that MongoDB and MySQL are both running on localhost.
