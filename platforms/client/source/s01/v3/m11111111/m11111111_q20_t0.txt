response, Assuming your data is fragmented and you need to pull data from different databases, here's a basic Python script to run the query using the 'mysql.connector' and 'pymongo' libraries.
1. Here is the python code, save it as 'query_script.py':

```python
import csv
from pymongo import MongoClient
import mysql.connector

# Connect to MongoDB server
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mongodb = client["tpch"]

# Connecting to MySQL
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(host="localhost", user="your_username", password="your_password", database="tpch")
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

supplier_col = mongodb["supplier"].find({}, {"_id": 0, "S_SUPPKEY": 1, "S_NAME": 1, "S_ADDRESS": 1, "S_NATIONKEY": 1})

supplier_list = [data for data in supplier_col]

for supplier in supplier_list:
    partsupp_query = f"SELECT PS_SUPPKEY FROM partsupp WHERE PS_PARTKEY IN (SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM PART WHERE P_NAME LIKE 'forest%') AND PS_AVAILQTY > (SELECT 0.5 * SUM(L_QUANTITY) FROM lineitem WHERE L_PARTKEY = {supplier['S_SUPPKEY']} AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01' AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01')"
    mycursor.execute(partsupp_query)
    results = mycursor.fetchall()

    for result in results:
        if (result[0] == supplier['S_SUPPKEY']):
            nation_query = f"SELECT N_NAME FROM nation WHERE N_NATIONKEY = {supplier['S_NATIONKEY']}"
            mycursor.execute(nation_query)
            nations = mycursor.fetchall()

            for nation in nations:
                if (nation[0] == 'CANADA'):
                    with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as file:
                        writer = csv.writer(file)
                        writer.writerow(['S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS'])
                        writer.writerow([supplier['S_NAME'], supplier['S_ADDRESS']])
```

To run the python code, use below bash command in the command line:

```bash
python query_script.py
```
2. bash command file (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code, save it as 'install_dependencies.sh':

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
```
To run the bash script, use below bash command in the command line:

```bash
bash install_dependencies.sh
```

Please adapt the python code and bash scripts accordingly based on your configuration requirements such as mysql username, password, hostname, etc. Also, note that this code is an approximation of using the original SQL query in a fragmented environment and has limitations considering that MongoDB doesn't use SQL-like join operations.
