response, In Python, here's how you can perform operations of the query using pymongo for MongoDB and mysql.connector for MySQL.

1. The Python code (.py)

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv
import mysql.connector

# Connect to mongodb
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mongodb = client['tpch']
orders = mongodb['orders']
lineitem = mongodb['lineitem']

# Connect to MySQL
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourUserName",
  password="yourPassword",
  database="tpch"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Get order records within given dates
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-07-01' AND O_ORDERDATE < '1993-10-01'")
mysql_orders = mycursor.fetchall()

# Perform steps in the subquery
subquery_ids = set()
for record in lineitem.find({}):
    if record['L_COMMITDATE'] < record['L_RECEIPTDATE']:
        subquery_ids.add(record['L_ORDERKEY'])

# Perform steps in the outer query
output = []
for order in mysql_orders:
    if order[0] in subquery_ids:
        output.append(order)

# Writing to query_output.csv
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(['O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'ORDER_COUNT'])
    for row in output:
        writer.writerow(row)
```

2. Bash command file (.sh) to install dependencies::

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the packages list
apt-get update -y

# Install Python3 and PIP
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the necessary python packages
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
pip3 install pymongo
```

Save this bash script in a file, give it execute permissions with `chmod +x filename.sh` and then run it with `./filename.sh`.

Remember to replace "localhost" with your servers' hostnames, "yourUserName" with your MySQL username and "yourPassword" with your MySQL password. 

Also note, this script only approximates the SQL query as MongoDB does not support SQL-like joins, and data in MongoDB may not be stored in a SQL-like tabular format. Some adjustments may need to be made depending on the specifics of your MongoDB data organization.
