response, Python Code (db_query.py):

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector

# Create connection to MySQL
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw',
                              host='mysql', db='tpch')
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = ("SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE "
         "FROM lineitem "
         "WHERE L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01' "
         "AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01' "
         "AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01 "
         "AND L_QUANTITY < 24")
cursor.execute(query)

# Write the result to the .csv file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)
    csv_writer.writerow(['REVENUE'])  # Header
    for result in cursor:
        csv_writer.writerow(result)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

Bash Command File (dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install necessary Python packages
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
pip3 install pymongo
```

To run the above code, you first execute the dependencies.sh file to install necessary dependencies:

```bash
chmod +x dependencies.sh
./dependencies.sh
```

Then run the python script using this command:

```bash
python3 db_query.py
```

Please note that this python script assumes that you have the MySQL database running on the same host where this script is executed. If not, please replace 'mysql' in host under mysql connector initialization in python script with the appropriate host address.
