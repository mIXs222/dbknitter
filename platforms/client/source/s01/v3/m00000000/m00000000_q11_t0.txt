response, To run the Python code and get the data, first you need to install a set of dependencies. Here is the Bash command to do this:

bash_commands.sh:
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
pip install pandas
pip install openpyxl
```

Once these dependencies are ready, you can run the Python code to execute the task.

Python Code(query.py):
```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# Connect to the mysql server

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

# Create cursor object
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Execute the SQL query
mycursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        PS_PARTKEY,
        SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) AS VALUE
    FROM
        partsupp,
        supplier,
        nation
    WHERE
        PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY
        AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
        AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'
    GROUP BY
        PS_PARTKEY HAVING
        SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) >
        (
        SELECT

        WHERE
            PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY
            AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
            AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'
        )
    ORDER BY
        VALUE DESC
""")

# Fetch all the rows into a list
rows = mycursor.fetchall()

# Create a pandas dataframe from the rows
df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=[i[0] for i in mycursor.description])

# Write the dataframe to a csv file
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# close the database connection
mydb.close()
```

The user stated that the data are stored on different platforms, but there is no specified other additional platforms and databases but MySql. So, the given code solution only works with MySql database.
