2. Bash command file (Filename: install_dependencies.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python-rf pymongo csv
```
Copy and paste each script into separate files with the given filenames. Before running the python script, make sure to run the bash script first to install all required dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the python script to fetch the data and write it into 'query_output.csv' file.

Also note, given the nature of your question it's been assumed that all the data is indeed stored in MySQL. If you have other databases or platforms, you'd need to adjust the Python script to connect and retrieve data from those databases/platforms as well. The Python script provided only considers MySQL as per your question, and deletes any mention of MongoDB. If MongoDB is actually involved, you'll need to adapt the script accordingly.
