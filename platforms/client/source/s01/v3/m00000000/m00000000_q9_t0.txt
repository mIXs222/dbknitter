response, The following solutions would involve using 'mysql.connector' for MySQL database and 'pymongo' for MongoDB. However, it is worth mentioning that the query and data you provided indicate all tables are in a MySQL database (named tpch), and there's no mention or indication of MongoDB or another database technology. I am providing you with a Python code that works only for MySQL database. Please adjust this code if your initial information was incorrect or not full. 

The Python Code:
```python
import mysql.connector
import csv

def get_data():
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host='mysql',
        user='root',
        password='my-secret-pw',
        database='tpch'
    )

    cursor = connection.cursor()

    query = """
        SELECT
            NATION,
            O_YEAR,
            SUM(AMOUNT) AS SUM_PROFIT
        FROM
            (
            SELECT
                N_NAME AS NATION,
                EXTRACT(YEAR FROM O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,

        GROUP BY
            NATION,

    cursor.execute(query)
    result = cursor.fetchall()
    
    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerows(result)

    cursor.close()
    connection.close()

get_data()
```

The Bash Script to Install Dependencies:
Note: The bash script assumes that Python (3.6+) and pip are already installed on the system.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo

python ./your_python_script.py
```

Replace `your_python_script.py` with the actual name of your python script.

To use this bash script, you have to give it permission to execute.
To do that, open your terminal and navigate to the directory with the bash script. Then you go:
```bash
chmod +x your_bash_script.sh
./your_bash_script.sh
```
Replace `your_bash_script.sh` with the actual name of your bash script.
