response, For the given scenario, it seems your data is located only in the MySQL database as MongoDB is not mentioned elsewhere. Here is how you can execute a query using Python and the MySQL connector.

1. Bash command to install the necessary libraries:

```
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas
```

2. Python Script:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# Create a connection to MySQL
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', database='tpch')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
        WITH revenue0 AS
        (SELECT
            L_SUPPKEY AS SUPPLIER_NO,
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
        FROM
            lineitem
        WHERE
            L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01'
            AND L_SHIPDATE < DATEADD(month, 3, '1996-01-01')
        GROUP BY
            L_SUPPKEY)
        SELECT
            S_SUPPKEY,
            S_NAME,
            S_ADDRESS,
            S_PHONE,
            TOTAL_REVENUE
        FROM
            supplier,
            revenue0
        WHERE
            S_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER_NO
            AND TOTAL_REVENUE = (
            SELECT
                MAX(TOTAL_REVENUE)
            FROM
                revenue0)
        ORDER BY
            S_SUPPKEY
        """

cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all rows from the result
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Get column names
columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]

# Create dataframe from rows and column names
df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=columns)

# Save dataframe to a csv file
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close all cursors and connections
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```
 
For the scenario where you also have a MongoDB database, you would need to adjust the Python script to connect to both MySQL and MongoDB, query data from each, and then combine the result. However, in your case, there's no specific database and table information provided for MongoDB. A part of the task also requires the handling of cases where a table may not exist in a database. To do this, you need to perform table existence checks before performing any queries on them. But since MongoDB isn't involved in this scenario, this isnâ€™t demonstrated in the script. The script as provided should work fine for the MySQL part.

Please replace localhost, user, password, and database_name with your actual MySQL database details.

Note: You may also want to handle exceptions(e.g., in case there are connection issues, the script can retry) in the script to make it more robust.

BASH script to install all dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In this case, `requirements.txt` file should contain:

```
mysql-connector-python
pandas
``` 

You will run the bash script with the command: `bash install_dependencies.sh`
