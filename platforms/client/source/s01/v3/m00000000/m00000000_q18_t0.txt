response, Based on the information you provided, it seems that the data is distributed on different databases in different platforms. Assuming that you have access and permissions to those databases and the "pymongo" and "mysql.connector" libraries are installed, you will need to connect to each platform and query/collect the data you need from each one, and then combine them in Python.

Here's a script with an outline of what you need to do in Python:

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MySQL server
mysql_conn = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Get data from MySQL server
mysql_cursor.execute("<your MySQL query here>")
mysql_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Connect to MongoDB server
mongo_client = MongoClient("<your MongoDB connection string here>")
mongo_db = mongo_client["<your MongoDB database here>"]

# Get data from MongoDB server
mongo_data = mongo_db.<your MongoDB collection here>.find(<your MongoDB query here>)

# Combine data from MySQL server and MongoDB server
combined_data = combine(mysql_data, mongo_data)  # You need to define the "combine" function

# Write the combined data to a CSV file
with open("query_output.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(combined_data)

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

To install the libraries, create a bash command file (.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo
```

Please replace placeholder text in script with actual parameters. Also, the supplied query is of MySQL syntax, you may need to modify the format if other platforms use different query languages. This script assumes that you know how the databases are distributed and you can write the corresponding queries for different platforms. 

Also, the 'combine' function isn't defined because it largely depends on the logic how you want to combine the data. CSV may not completely store the nested documents coming from MongoDB. So, you might need to parse the MongoDB data accordingly before writing to CSV.
