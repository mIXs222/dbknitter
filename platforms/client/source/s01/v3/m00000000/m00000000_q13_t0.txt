response, Based on the information in the task, the data you're trying to query is all coming from MySQL ("tpch"). There's no mention of other databases or platforms. Thus I will provide a code for the MySQL database and do not see the need for pymongo here.

Python Code to run your SQL query:

```python
import mysql.connector
import csv

# Define your database configuration
db_config = {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "host": "mysql",
    "database": "tpch",
}

# Connect to MySQL server
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Define your SQL query
sql_query = """
SELECT
    C_COUNT,
    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        C_CUSTKEY,
        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT
    FROM
        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON
        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%%pending%%deposits%%'
    GROUP BY
        C_CUSTKEY
    )   C_ORDERS
GROUP BY
    C_COUNT
ORDER BY
    CUSTDIST DESC,
    C_COUNT DESC
"""

# Execute your SQL query
cursor.execute(sql_query)

# Open your CSV file and write the data into it
with open("query_output.csv", "w") as f:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(f)
    csv_writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])  # write headers
    csv_writer.writerows(cursor.fetchall())

# Don't forget to close the database connection
cnx.close()
```

Dependencies installation bash command file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
pip install csv
```
Finally, you can run your bash script with:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

Replace 'script.sh' with the name of your bash script. This will install the necessary dependencies to run your Python script.
