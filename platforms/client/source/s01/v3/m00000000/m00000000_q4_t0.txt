```

Bash commands:

```bash
#1. Python install dependencies
echo "pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo" > install_dependencies.sh

#2. Run python script
echo "python query.py" >> run.sh
echo "cat query_output.csv" >> run.sh
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
chmod +x run.sh
```

Note: Above bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) should be run to install the required dependencies to run the python code and `run.sh` is to run the python code and view the output from the `query_output.csv` file. It can be run with command `./install_dependencies.sh` and `./run.sh` respectively in the terminal.

Regarding your instructions to use pymongo, in this case, we do not have any MongoDB database involved. Thus, there is no use of pymongo library in the provided code. The pymongo library is generally used to connect to MongoDB databases, and perform various operations over collections and documents. If you have MongoDB database, adjustments in the code will be needed accordingly.
