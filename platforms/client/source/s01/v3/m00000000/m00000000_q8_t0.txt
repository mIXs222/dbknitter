response, To execute this SQL query in Python we can use the mysql.connector library. However, since there is only one database involved in your question, I'll write a Python code that only interacts with that single MySQL database.

Here is some Python code for executing the SQL query and writing the output in a csv file in Python:

```python
# mysql_connector.py
import csv
import mysql.connector

def execute_sql_query():
  db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password="my-secret-pw",
    database="tpch"
  )
  
  cursor = db.cursor()

  cursor.execute("""
  SELECT
    O_YEAR,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NATION = 'INDIA' THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) / SUM(VOLUME) AS MKT_SHARE
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        strftime('%Y', O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME,
        N2.N_NAME AS NATION
    FROM
        part,
        supplier,
        lineitem,
        orders,
        customer,
        nation n1,
        nation n2,
        region
    WHERE
        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY
        AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
        AND O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY
        AND C_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY
        AND N1.N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY
        AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'
        AND S_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY
        AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'
        AND P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'
    ) AS ALL_NATIONS
GROUP BY
    O_YEAR
    ORDER BY
    O_YEAR
  """)

  with open("query_output.csv", mode='w') as csv_file:
    writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
    writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description]) # writing headers
    writer.writerows(cursor.fetchall()) # writing data

if __name__ == "__main__":
  execute_sql_query()
```

Here is the bash command for creating the .sh file. This script will install the necessary libraries to run the Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
echo 'Installing dependencies...'
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
echo 'Dependencies installed successfully.'
```

To run these codes:
1. Save each of the above scripts in a separate file with names mysql_connector.py and install_dependencies.sh respectively.
2. Run the bash script using the command: `bash install_dependencies.sh`.
3. Then run the python script with the command `python3 mysql_connector.py`.
