response, Bash commandspython Code (query.py):

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector

db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(host="mysql", user="root", password="my-secret-pw", database="tpch")

cursor = db_connection.cursor()

cursor.execute("""
SELECT
    100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)
    ELSE 0
    END) / SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS PROMO_REVENUE
FROM
    lineitem,
    part
WHERE
    L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
    AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01'
    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01'
""")

result_set = cursor.fetchall()

with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(result_set)
```

Bash Command File (setup.sh) to install python dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python-rf
pip install pymongo
```

To execute the query.py file,

In your terminal command line, change your current directory to where your python file resides. 

$ cd /path_where_your_python_file_resides
Then you can call your python file from the command line,

$ python query.py

The query.py file will run and it will write the output to `query_output.csv`

Instruction on how to run the .sh file,
1) Move to the folder where your file is in terminal
cd /path_where_your_sh_script_resides

2) To make the .sh file executable, type
chmod +x setup.sh

3) Run your script:
./setup.sh

This will install the required dependencies to run the python script.

If Python and pip are not installed, they will need to be installed first. These instructions are assuming that both are installed.++
