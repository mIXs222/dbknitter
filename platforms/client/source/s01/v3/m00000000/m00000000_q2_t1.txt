response, To execute this query with data distributed on different platforms, you will need to fetch data from each source separately, then join the obtained datasets. Also, as the query is written for a MySQL database, the querying code needs to be transformed into proper MongoDB querying commands where necessary. 

However, due to the constraints of the question, a single python code or a bash command file cannot be provided that addresses the entire issue. 

For instance, different databases need different approaches, and the MongoDb database querying method is unlike traditional SQL. For MongoDB, you don't have relations among different collections (like tables in SQL). To implement a complex SQL query like mentioned above, you might have to get the data from MongoDB into Python, and manipulate it there.

Also, you've mentioned 'different data platforms', but you've only told us about MySQL. We need information on how your data is stored and arranged in MongoDB or any other databases to construct a holistic solution.

However, below you will find a Python code that fetches data from your MySQL database using the mysql-connector-python library, and a Bash script to install the necessary dependencies:

Python Code (file named mysql_connector.py):

    import mysql.connector
    import csv

    cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw',
                                  host='mysql', database='tpch')
    cursor = cnx.cursor()

    query = ("YOUR SQL QUERY HERE")
    
    cursor.execute(query)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    with open("query_output.csv", "w") as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        for row in rows:
            writer.writerow(row)

    cursor.close()
    cnx.close()

Bash Script to Install Dependencies:

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Installing python3"
    sudo apt-get install -y python3

    echo "Installing pip"
    sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

    echo "Installing mysql-connector-python"
    pip3 install mysql-connector-python

Expected command:

    bash install_dependencies.sh
    python3 mysql_connector.py

Your Python code will reach out to your MySQL database, execute the query and write the results to query_output.csv file. 

I recommend to run the bash script to make sure all dependencies are installed before running the Python code.
