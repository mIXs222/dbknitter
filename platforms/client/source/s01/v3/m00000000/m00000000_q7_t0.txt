response, Since you haven't mentioned usage of MongoDB server and only specified the MySQL database, here are the Python script and bash command file for MySQL.

Python code to execute the above query:

```python
import mysql.connector
import csv

def execute_query_and_save_data():

    # Connect to the MySQL server
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="mysql",
        user="root",
        password="my-secret-pw",
        database="tpch"
    )

    # prepare a cursor object 
    cursor = mydb.cursor()

    query = """SELECT SUPP_NATION, CUST_NATION, L_YEAR, SUM(VOLUME) AS REVENUE FROM 
        (SELECT N1.N_NAME AS SUPP_NATION, N2.N_NAME AS CUST_NATION, 
        strftime('%Y', L_SHIPDATE) AS L_YEAR, 
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME 
        FROM supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, nation n1, nation n2 
        WHERE S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY AND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
        AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY AND S_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY 
        AND C_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY AND ((N1.N_NAME = 'JAPAN' AND N2.N_NAME = 'INDIA')
        OR (N1.N_NAME = 'INDIA' AND N2.N_NAME = 'JAPAN')) 
        AND L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31') AS SHIPPING 
        GROUP BY SUPP_NATION, CUST_NATION, L_YEAR 
        ORDER BY SUPP_NATION, CUST_NATION, L_YEAR """

    cursor.execute(query)

    # Fetch all the records
    result = cursor.fetchall()

    # Write data to file
    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerows(result)

execute_query_and_save_data()
```
Above Python code will connect to MySQL server, execute the query and then write the output to query_output.csv file.

--------------------------
For the bash command file to install dependencies, here is an example (.sh) assuming you are using Python3 and pip3:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading
sudo apt-get update

# Python3 pip install 
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install mysql connector for Python
pip3 install mysql-connector-python

# Install pymongo for Python
pip3 install pymongo
```

Please save the above bash commands in a file (let's say `dependencies.sh`), give executable permissions using `chmod +x dependencies.sh` and then execute it with `./dependencies.sh`.

Please note that:
Your MySQL server should be running and accessible at the provided host, also the database and tables should exist. Also, the user should have the necessary permissions to execute the SELECT query.

The exact usernames, passwords, hostnames, database names mentioned in the question are used in the python code. Please replace them with actual values while implementing in the production environment.
