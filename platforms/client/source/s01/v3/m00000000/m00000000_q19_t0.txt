response, To execute this task, you need python and a couple of libraries. MySql connector for python to execute SQL queries and pymongo to connect with the MongoDB database. Also, since you want to write the output to a csv file, you'll need csv module as well. Here's the python code:

1. The python code

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient

def execute_query(database, query):
    if database == 'mysql':
        user = 'root'
        password = 'my-secret-pw'
        host = 'mysql'
        
        conn = mysql.connector.connect(user=user, password=password, host=host, database='tpch')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query)
        return cursor

    elif database == 'mongodb':
        client = MongoClient()
        db = client['tpch']
        return db.command({'aggregate': 'lineitem', 'pipeline': query})

def write_to_csv(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerows(data)

def main():
    query = """
    SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE*(1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
    FROM lineitem, part..........
    """
    cursor = execute_query('mysql', query)
    data = [(row['REVENUE'], ) for row in cursor]
    write_to_csv(data, 'query_output.csv')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace the `query = """......"""` with the entire query string.

2. The bash script to install the dependencies

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
pip3 install pymongo
```

Save this script as 'dependencies.sh'. Running this script would install python, pip, pymysql and pymongo for you to run the python script. 

To run the bash script use this command in terminal:

```bash
bash dependencies.sh
```

Then you can run your python script:

```bash
python3 query.py
```
