response, Sure. Please find the sample python script as follows. Please keep in mind that we are assuming that all your data are keeping in "mysql", none in "mongodb" as there is no reference to "mongodb" in your request.

The Python Code (query.py):

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector

# Establishing DB connection
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
   host="mysql",
   user="root",
   password="my-secret-pw",
   database="tpch"
)
# SQL statement
mycursor = mydb.cursor()
sql = """

mycursor.execute(sql)

rows = mycursor.fetchall()

# Write to a CSV File:
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as f:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(f)
    csv_writer.writerows(rows)

mydb.close()
```

This code first establish a connection with the MySQL server and then fetches the data by executing the provided SQL query. The fetched data is written into a CSV file using the built-in csv module in Python.

Bash Command File (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
pip install csv

python 'query.py'
```

This Bash script will first update the version of pip to ensure that it can correctly install packages. Then it installs mysql-connector-python and pymongo for connecting to the MySQL server and MongoDB server, respectively. At last, it will install the csv module which is used to write output data into a CSV file. 

Please note that, for running the bash file (.sh), you'll need to give it "execute" permission. You can do so with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
``` 

Afterwards, for running the file you only need to call it as follows:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
``` 

Please double-check all database details and ensure your Python version is compatible with the used libraries.
