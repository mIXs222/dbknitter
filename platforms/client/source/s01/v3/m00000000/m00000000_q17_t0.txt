response, Here's the Python code and bash commands you need. 

1. Python Code (main.py)

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector

def run_query():
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="mysql",
        user="root",
        password="my-secret-pw",
        database="tpch"
    )

    mycursor = mydb.cursor()

    mycursor.execute("""
        SELECT
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY
        FROM
            lineitem,
            part
        WHERE
            P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
            AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'
            AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'
            AND L_QUANTITY < (
                SELECT
                    0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY)
                FROM
                    lineitem
                WHERE
                    L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
            )
    """)

    results = mycursor.fetchall()

    write_to_csv(results)

def write_to_csv(results):
    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerows(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_query()
```

2. Bash commands to install dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install mysql-connector-python 
pip3 install pymongo
python3 main.py
```

To run these bash commands, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash install_dependencies.sh
```

This script first updates the package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading, as well as new packages that have just come to the repositories. Then it installs pip for Python 3. And after that it installs the MySQL Connector Python and pymongo modules for Python 3, which you can use to connect to your MySQL and MongoDB databases. Finally, it runs the Python script (main.py) that gets the data from your database.
