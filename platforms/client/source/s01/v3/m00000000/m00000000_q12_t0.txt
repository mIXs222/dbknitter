2. Bash command file:

First you will need to make sure python is installed in your system. You can install or upgrade python by using package manager like apt for Linux or brew for MacOS.

Then the following command will install the dependencies:
```
pip install mysql-connector-python-rf
pip install pymongo
pip install csv
```

After that you can run the python script with the following command:
```
python your-python-file-name.py
```

If pip or python is not installed in your system. You could install them by using the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
```
