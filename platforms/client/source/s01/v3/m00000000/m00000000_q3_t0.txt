response, I'm inferring from your question that different parts of your data could be spread across various data platforms, such as MySQL, MongoDB, etc. However, in your initial scenario, you only mentioned MySQL database. Also, you are asking for the generation of a Python code which assumes that all data is stored in MySQL. 

Here is Python code to execute the query, save the output to a CSV file using 'mysql.connector':

Python code (data_query.py):
```python
import mysql.connector
import csv

cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', 
                              host='mysql', database='tpch')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Execute the query
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        L_ORDERKEY,
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,
        O_ORDERDATE,
        O_SHIPPRIORITY
    FROM
        customer,
        orders,
        lineitem
    WHERE
        C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'
        AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
        AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
        AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'
        AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
    GROUP BY
        L_ORDERKEY,
        O_ORDERDATE,
        O_SHIPPRIORITY
    ORDER BY
        REVENUE DESC,
        O_ORDERDATE
""")

# Fetch results into a CSV file 'query_output.csv'
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])  # write headers
    writer.writerows(cursor.fetchall())  # write data

# Close the cursor and disconnect from the server
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```
And here is a bash script which can be used to install necessary Python libraries. If your user wants to execute it, they should give it execute permissions (with chmod +x install_dependencies.sh) and run it with ./install_dependencies.sh.

Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Please be aware that the actual Python connector may vary depending on the MySQL version or the Python version you are using. If you have distributed data across different databases, you will need to provide additional details on how to organize this data. This could be a much more complex task than a single SQL query can accomplish.
