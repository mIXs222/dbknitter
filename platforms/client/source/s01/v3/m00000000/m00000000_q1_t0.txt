response, Given the information in your question, I assume that all of your data exists in MySQL. However, you mentioned the possibility that some may exist in MongoDB. However, since you have not provided any specific information on that end (names of collections or column names), I can't possibly write accurate Python code regarding the MongoDB portion.

Therefore, I'll just provide the MySQL portion here based on the information you've provided. I'm also assuming that the MySQL server is running locally on port 3306.

1. Python code

```python
import mysql.connector
import csv

# create a mysql connection
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', database='tpch')

# create a cursor
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# define the query
query = """
SELECT
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
ORDER BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS"""

# execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# fetch all results
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# write results to csv file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])  # write headers
    writer.writerows(rows)  # write data

# close the cursor & connection
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

2. Bash command file

Create a bash file `setup.sh` to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
pip install csv
```

Remember to run `chmod +x ./setup.sh` to make this script executable.
