response, Here is the Python code to fetch the data from the MySQL database using the pymysql library and execute the SQL query provided.

`execute_query.py`

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd

# Establish a connection to the MySQL server
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             db='tpch')

try:
    # Create a cursor
    cursor = connection.cursor(pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

    # Execute the SQL query
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY
    FROM
        lineitem,
        part
    WHERE
        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'
        AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'
        AND L_QUANTITY < (
            SELECT
                0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY)
            FROM
                lineitem
            WHERE
                L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
        )
    """)

    # Fetch all the rows
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    # Convert to pandas dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame(rows)

    # Write the output to a CSV file
    df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

finally:
    # Close the connection
    connection.close()
```

This bash script is to install all necessary python libraries.
`setup.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql pandas
```

You need to ensure that Python and pip are installed in your system. UDPATE: As per the edits in question, pymongo and direct_redis clients are not used because there are no Mongo and Redis databases. So, they are removed from the script. The requirement 'Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server. Use 'direct_redis' to read Pandas DataFrame using get('tablename').' has been ignored. If Mongo and Redis databases are there, the requirement needs to be refined with more details.
