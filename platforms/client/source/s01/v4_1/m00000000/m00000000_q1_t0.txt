Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database. Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server. Use 'direct_redis' to read Pandas DataFrame using get('tablename')."},2
