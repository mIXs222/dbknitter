Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database. Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server. Use 'direct_redis' to read Pandas DataFrame using get('tablename')."},2

2. Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pymysql
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pandas
```

Please replace `"python3-pymysql"` and `"python3-pandas"` with the actual package names in your system's package manager, if they are different. This script assumes that `sudo` and `apt-get` are present, which may not be the case on some systems like macOS or certain Linux distributions.
