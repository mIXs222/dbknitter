Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database. Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server. Use 'direct_redis' to read Pandas DataFrame using get('tablename')."},2

Bash Script (install.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/sh

pip install pymysql
pip install csv
```

This Python code connects to the MySQL server with the specified credentials and executes the SQL query provided. It then extracts all the data and stores it in the 'result' variable. The fetched data is processed row-by-row and written into a CSV (comma-separated values) file named 'query_output.csv'. 

The Bash script installs PyMySQL which is a Python MySQL client enabling Python programs to access MySQL databases, and csv module for reading and writing CSV files. It uses `pip` which is  a package installer for Python.
