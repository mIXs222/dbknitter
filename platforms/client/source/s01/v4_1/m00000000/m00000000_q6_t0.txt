Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database. Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server. Use 'direct_redis' to read Pandas DataFrame using get('tablename')."},2

response, 1. Python code to connect to myoriginal data and execute the query:

```python
import csv
import pandas as pd
import pymysql

# connect to MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch')

# create cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# execute SQL query
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE
    FROM
        lineitem
    WHERE
        L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'
        AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'
        AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01
        AND L_QUANTITY < 24
""")

# fetch all rows from the last executed SQL statement
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# create pandas dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=['REVENUE'])

# write to csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# close DB connection
connection.close()
```

2. Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install python3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3.8

# install pip3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# install pymysql, pandas and csv packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas
```

Notes:
1. This is assuming that pymysql and pandas are the only additional packages needed to run the python code. If there are additional dependencies needed, those packages can be added to the pip3 install command.
2. This is assuming that Python3 and pip3 are not yet installed in the machine. If they are installed, the lines to install python3 and pip3 can be omitted.
3. The python code connects only to the MySQL database because there is no other databases mentioned in the scenario. If there were databases in MongoDB or Redis, appropriate code to fetch the relevant data would have been included.
