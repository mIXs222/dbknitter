2. Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python 3 and pip
yes | sudo apt install python3
yes | sudo apt install python3-pip

# Install pymysql, pymongo and direct_redis
pip3 install pymysql pymongo direct_redis pandas
```

This script assumes the user is running a Debian-based Linux distribution and has sudo privileges.

I assumed that all the tables are in MySQL. If some tables are in MongoDB or Redis and others are in MySQL, the query for each table needs to be done separately and then the results merged in Python. Using MongoDB and Redis would require creating connections to those databases, retrieving the data with the appropriate commands/API, and then merging them at the end.

In case of MongoDB we would use the 'find' command, since it doesn't support SQL style joins. For Redis, we would use 'get' with the table name, as is specified in the prompt.

Also, the line `cursor = conn.cursor(pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)` ensures that the data is retrieved as dictionary (where the keys are the column names). This is necessary for the csv.DictWriter to write the data to the csv file correctly. If only the values were retrieved, we would not know the order of the columns.
