Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database. Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server. Use 'direct_redis' to read Pandas DataFrame using get('tablename')."},2

# write the DataFrame into csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

```
2. Bash script (dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# update packages
apt-get update -y

# install pip
apt-get install python3-pip -y

# install MySQL client
apt-get install mysql-client -y

# install required python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas
```
Please run this bash script as a super user or use sudo command. After you run this script, you can run the python script as follows:
```bash
python3 query.py
```
It will generate the output file named 'query_output.csv'.
