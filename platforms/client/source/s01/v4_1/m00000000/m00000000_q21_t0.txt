response, The task seems to be a little bit unclear whether the Python code is required to retrieve data just from MySQL or from any other additional data platforms. However, based on provided information about the tables and connection information, I will provide Python code to retrieve data from MySQL. 

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql

db = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
cursor = db.cursor()

sql_query = """
SELECT S_NAME, COUNT(*) AS NUMWAIT
FROM supplier, lineitem AS L1, orders, nation
WHERE S_SUPPKEY = L1.L_SUPPKEY
AND O_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY
AND O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'
AND L1.L_RECEIPTDATE > L1.L_COMMITDATE
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM lineitem AS L2
    WHERE L2.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY
    AND L2.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM lineitem AS L3
    WHERE L3.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY
    AND L3.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY
    AND L3.L_RECEIPTDATE > L3.L_COMMITDATE
)
AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
AND N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
GROUP BY S_NAME
ORDER BY NUMWAIT DESC, S_NAME
"""

df = pd.read_sql(sql_query, con=db)
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

db.close()
```

Bash script to install the dependencies:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Updating package lists for upgrades and new package installations..."
sudo apt-get update

echo "Installing python3-pip..."
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

echo "Installing pymysql..."
pip3 install pymysql

echo "Installing pandas..."
pip3 install pandas

echo "Finished installing dependencies."
``` 

NOTE: Run this bash script using a command: `bash script.sh`
The script firsts updates the package lists for upgrades and new package installations. Then it installs pip3. Afterward, it installs pymysql and pandas using pip3. 

Please ensure to add information regarding any other platforms and necessary Python libraries if required, so correct data retrieval and integration can be performed accordingly.
