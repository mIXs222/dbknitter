Table REGION has the following columns: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS,\n    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,\n    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,\n    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,\n    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,\n    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'\nGROUP BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\nORDER BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here's a Python code to execute this query and output the results.

Python code:

```python
import csv
import MySQLdb
import pymongo

# Connect to MySQL
db_mysql = MySQLdb.connect(user='root', passwd='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', db='tpch')

# Connect to MongoDB
client_mongo = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db_mongo = client_mongo['tpch']

# Cursor
cursor = db_mysql.cursor()

# Query
query = """
SELECT
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER

    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY

    L_LINESTATUS
ORDER BY

"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch data
data = cursor.fetchall()

# Write data into CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])  # write headers
    writer.writerows(data)  # write data
   
# Close connections    
db_mysql.close()
client_mongo.close()
```

Bash command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install MySQL-python pymongo csv
```
Please note that above python code and bash command are written assuming that you are using Python 2.7. If you're using Python 3.x, replace `MySQL-python` with `mysql-connector-python` in the bash command. At the same time, replace `import MySQLdb` with `import mysql.connector as MySQLdb` in the Python code.
