Table REGION has the following columns: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'\n    AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'\nGROUP BY\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nORDER BY\n    REVENUE DESC,\n    O_ORDERDATE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the python code to execute your query using the Mysql connector.

Python code:
```python
import mysql.connector
import csv

# Define MySQL Config
config = {
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'host': 'mysql',
    'database': 'tpch',
    'raise_on_warnings': True
}

# Establish Connection
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(**config)

# Cursor for execution
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Store your SQL Query here
query = ("""
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY
FROM
    CUSTOMER,
    ORDERS,
    LINEITEM
WHERE
    C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'
    AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'
    AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY
    L_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY
ORDER BY
    REVENUE DESC,
    O_ORDERDATE""")

cursor.execute(query)

# Get Result
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Writing to .csv
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(results)

# Close Cursor and Connection
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

Use the below bash command for installing mysql python connector
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
