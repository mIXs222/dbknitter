For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    S_ACCTBAL,\n    S_NAME,\n    N_NAME,\n    P_PARTKEY,\n    P_MFGR,\n    S_ADDRESS,\n    S_PHONE,\n    S_COMMENT\nFROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    partsupp,\n    nation,\n    region\nWHERE\n    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n    AND S_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY\n    AND P_SIZE = 15\n    AND P_TYPE LIKE '%BRASS'\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY\n    AND R_NAME = 'EUROPE'\n    AND PS_SUPPLYCOST = (\n        SELECT\n            MIN(PS_SUPPLYCOST)\n        FROM\n            partsupp,\n            supplier,\n            nation,\n            region\n        WHERE\n            P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n            AND S_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY\n            AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n            AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY\n            AND R_NAME = 'EUROPE'\n        )\nORDER BY\n    S_ACCTBAL DESC,\n    N_NAME,\n    S_NAME,\n    P_PARTKEY\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.
