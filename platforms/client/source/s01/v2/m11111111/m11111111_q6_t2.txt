response, You'll need the `pymongo` library to communicate with MongoDB and `pandas` library to perform SQL-like operations on the data that you've retrieved from MongoDB and to write the result to a CSV file.

1. Here is a Python code snippet that retrieves the data from the MongoDB database, applies the filtering conditions and calculates the required sum:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')  # create a MongoClient to the running mongod instance
db = client['tpch']  # access the tpch database
lineitem_collection = db['lineitem']  # access the lineitem table

# Retrieve all documents from the lineitem collection
lineitem_data = list(lineitem_collection.find())

# Convert list of dictionaries to DataFrame
data_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitem_data)

# Convert string to datetime
data_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(data_df['L_SHIPDATE'])

# Apply filtering conditions
filtered_data_df = data_df[
    (data_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= datetime(1994, 1, 1)) &
    (data_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < datetime(1995, 1, 1)) &
    (data_df['L_DISCOUNT'].between(0.06 - 0.01, 0.06 + 0.01)) &   
    (data_df['L_QUANTITY'] < 24)
]

# Calculate the sum 
revenue = filtered_data_df['L_DISCOUNT'].multiply(filtered_data_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE']).sum()

# Write result to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as f:
    f.write("REVENUE\n")
    f.write(str(revenue))
```

This script could be saved as `query.py`.

2. Here is a bash script to install needed Python dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

This script could be saved as `deps.sh`. 

Use the command `sh deps.sh` in your bash terminal to install all needed dependencies. 

After that, you can run your python script (e.g., `query.py`) by calling `python query.py` in the terminal.

Replace 'localhost' with your server address if your MongoDB server is not on your local machine. Note that your MongoDB server must be running for the python code to successfully connect and execute the query.
