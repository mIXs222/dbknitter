response, 1. Python code (.py file)

First, we need to install the necessary python libraries. The pymongo library is for connecting python with MongoDB, the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis and mysql-connector-python for connecting Python with MySQL.

Here's how you can write the Python code:

```python
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']
collection_part = db['part']
collection_lineitem = db['lineitem']

# Get data from MongoDB
part_data = pd.DataFrame(list(collection_part.find()))
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(collection_lineitem.find()))

# Connection to mysql
db_mysql = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    password="password",
    database="tpch"
)

cursor = db_mysql.cursor()

# Execute MySQL query
cursor.execute("""
SELECT
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY
FROM
    lineitem,
    part
WHERE
    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'
    AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'
    AND L_QUANTITY < (
        SELECT
            0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY)
        FROM
            lineitem
        WHERE
            L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
    )
""")

# Fetch all rows from the last executed statement
mysql_data = cursor.fetchall()
mysql_df = pd.DataFrame(mysql_data, columns=['AVG_YEARLY'])

# Save the result to csv
mysql_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Note: Please replace the `localhost`, `user`, and `password` fields with your MySQL server details.

2. Bash commands (.sh file)

The bash commands needed to install Python3, Pip and the necessary Python libraries are:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install pymongo pandas mysql-connector-python
```

Note: Instructions for installing Python3 and Pip may vary depending on the operating system. This script is applicable for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems. For other OS, modify the package install commands appropriately. Also MongoDB and MySQL connector PyPI packages may require some preinstalled system packages. You might need to install them based on the errors you get while installing pymongo and mysql-connector-python.
