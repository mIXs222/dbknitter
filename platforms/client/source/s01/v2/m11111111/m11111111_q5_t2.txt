response, First of all, MongoDB is a NoSQL database that doesn't support SQL queries out of the box. To perform SQL-like operations, you would need to use MongoDB's aggregation framework, but it would become complex when there are joins and group operations.

However, there are external tools like Apache Drill or Metabase that allows us to connect MongoDB and run SQL queries directly. But, rewriting mentioned SQL into MongoDB's internal join and group operations seems difficult.

Since you specifically asked for Python implementation, I could suggest another approach where you could fetch data from MongoDB into a dataframe and perform operations like you would do on MySQL. Here, I am providing an example of how you can fetch data in a pandas dataframe and perform SQL queries on that.

1. Python Code:
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from pandasql import sqldf

client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017")
db = client['tpch']

def pysqldf(query):
    return sqldf(query, globals())

query = """
SELECT
    N_NAME,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
FROM
    customer,
    orders,
    lineitem,
    supplier,
    nation,
    region
WHERE
    C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
    AND L_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY
    AND C_NATIONKEY = S_NATIONKEY
    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
    AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY
    AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'
    AND O_ORDERDATE >= '1990-01-01'
    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-01-01'
GROUP BY
    N_NAME
ORDER BY
    REVENUE DESC
"""

tables = ['nation', 'region', 'supplier', 'customer', 'orders', 'lineitem']

for table in tables:
    globals()[table] = pd.DataFrame(list(db[table].find()))

result = pysqldf(query)
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```
Please note that you need to have pymongo, pandas, pandasql in your python environment and mongodb service running on your host.

2. Bash commands(.sh) to install all dependencies for this python script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
pip install pymongo pandas pandasql
```

This script will install pandas, pymongo and pandasql python libraries which are needed for the query execution script to run. This bash script needs to be run in an environment where pip and python are available as it uses pip to install the libraries.
