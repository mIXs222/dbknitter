response, As your data resides in MongoDB (NoSQL database), not MySQL (relational database), you cannot perform SQL operations directly on the data. You need to get the data from MongoDB and transform it accordingly. Here is a simple Python code to establish a connection to MongoDB and fetch data. 

Unfortunately, MongoDB doesn't support SQL out of the box. There are tools like Apache Drill that can help with this, but to keep everything in Python, you have to write your equivalent code.

Python (.py) code:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# Establish MongoDB connection
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['tpch']

# Get collections (equivalent to tables)
nation = pd.DataFrame(list(db.nation.find()))
supplier = pd.DataFrame(list(db.supplier.find()))
part = pd.DataFrame(list(db.part.find()))
partsupp = pd.DataFrame(list(db.partsupp.find()))
region = pd.DataFrame(list(db.region.find()))

# Perform operations similar to SQL here
...

# Write data to CSV
data.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

Bash command (.sh) file to install dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

This Python and Bash code are only a starting point. The "... " in the Python code is where you'd have to write code to perform your filtering, joining, aggregation, etc., operations that would otherwise be carried out by the SQL query. Depending on the size of your data, you might need to do this in smaller steps or even use tools such as Apache Spark to handle larger amounts of data.

Please note that MongoDB does support its flavor of SQL queries to some extent through MongoDB Compass application, but this may not be sufficient for complex queries or larger datasets.
