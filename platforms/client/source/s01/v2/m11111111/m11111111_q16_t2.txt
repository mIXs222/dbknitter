response, Here is the bash commands to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo
pip install pandas
```
Save it as `install.sh`.

Here is a python code to execute the query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

def query_mongodb():
    # Connect to MongoDB
    client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
    # Select database and collection
    db = client['tpch']

    # Select part and partsupp collections
    part = db['part']
    partsupp = db['partsupp']

    # Create dataframes
    part_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part.find()))
    partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(partsupp.find()))

    # Merge dataframes
    merge_df = pd.merge(partsupp_df, part_df, how='inner', left_on="PS_PARTKEY", right_on="P_PARTKEY")

    # Filter rows
    condition_df = merge_df[(merge_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45') & 
                            (~merge_df['P_TYPE'].str.contains('MEDIUM POLISHED')) & 
                            (merge_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]))]

    # Group by columns and apply count function
    final_df = condition_df.groupby(['P_BRAND','P_TYPE','P_SIZE'])['PS_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index(name='SUPPLIER_CNT')

    # Filter supplier collection
    supplier = db['supplier']
    supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier.find()))
    supplier_df = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

    # Get SUPPKEY which is not in supplier dataframe
    final_df = final_df[~final_df['PS_SUPPKEY'].isin(supplier_df['S_SUPPKEY'])]

    # Sort df
    final_df = final_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

    # Save to csv
    final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    query_mongodb()
```

Save it as `query.py`.

Note that this script only connects to MongoDB. In your scenario, you said "databases of different platforms". If this means you have other types of databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL), then you would need other scripts to handle their interaction and combine the results.

In an operational environment, this type of data retrieval and manipulation possibly be better done directly in the different database systems or using a more specialized data orchestration tool, rather than trying to do everything purely in Python.
