# Connection to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client['tpch']
orders_coll = db['orders']
lineitem_coll = db['lineitem']

# Fetch data from MongoDB
orders_data = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_coll.find({}, {'_id': 0})))
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_coll.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Load data into MySQL (Supposing the MySQL server is running locally at port 3306)

2. Bash command file (setup.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install pymongo pandas sqlalchemy
```

NOTE:
- Replace "username" and "password" with your MySQL username and password.
- This code assumes that both MongoDB and MySQL are running on your local machine (localhost). If not, change hosts accordingly.
- The Python script transfers data from MongoDB to MySQL which may not be practical for large datasets. A more efficient solution would be to rewrite the query specifically for MongoDB.
- Before running the Python code, you should first run the bash command file to make sure all the necessary Python libraries are installed.
- If MySQL is not installed then add the MySQL installation command in setup.sh.
