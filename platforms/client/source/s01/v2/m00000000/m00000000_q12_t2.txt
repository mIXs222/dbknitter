response, To execute this task, we will first need the Python libraries `mysql-connector-python` and `pandas` installed on your system. The bash script to install these is:

1. Bash Command File (dependencies.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas
```

Next, we can create a Python script for executing the SQL query and exporting the result to a CSV file.

2. Python Code (execute_query.py)
```python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector

def execute_query():
    db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="mysql",
        database="tpch",
        user="root",
        password="my-secret-pw"
    )

    query = """

                WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY = '1-URGENT'
                OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = '2-HIGH'
                THEN 1
                ELSE 0
        END) AS HIGH_LINE_COUNT,
        SUM(CASE

                AND O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '2-HIGH'
                THEN 1

        AND L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01'

    ORDER BY
        L_SHIPMODE
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(query, db_connection)
    df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    execute_query()
```

In these scripts, make sure to replace the host, username, password, and database name with your actual credentials.

To run these scripts, first give execute permissions to the bash script using the command `chmod +x dependencies.sh` and then run it using `./dependencies.sh`.

The python script can be run using the command `python execute_query.py`. The output of the query will be written to the `query_output.csv` file.
