response, There are several steps that need to be taken before running the query. Because your data is spread across multiple databases and we're not sure where each table resides, you'd need to establish connection with each database separately, execute the relevant part of the query on each and then join the results on the Python side. In this response, I'll assume all tables are in the MySQL database for the sake of simplicity. 

Python code to execute the query:

```python
# query.py 
import mysql.connector
import csv
import pandas as pd

# Create a connection
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw',
                              host='mysql', database='tpch')

# Create a cursor
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Define the query
query = """YOUR_SQL_QUERY"""

# Execute
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all the rows
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Get column names
column_names = [i[0] for i in cursor.description]

# Create dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=column_names)

# Write to CSV
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the cursor
cursor.close()

# Close the connection
cnx.close()
```
Please replace "YOUR_SQL_QUERY" with your query specified above.

The bash script to install all python requirements:

```bash
# install.sh
# Ensure pip is installed
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

# Install necessary Python packages
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas
```

This is the most straightforward way of running the query you provided, assuming all tables are in the MySQL database. If each table is in a different database, you will have to retrieve data from each table separately and then use Python (pandas library would be useful in this case) to perform the operations that SQL would otherwise perform (JOINs, conditionals and aggregation functions). 

Please note that your SQL query has SQLite's strftime function which isn't supported in MySQL. If you have date in MySQL it's better to use its own functions such as EXTRACT function to extract the specific part of the date or date/time

Make sure both scripts are executable. You can use `chmod +x query.py` and `chmod +x install.sh` to make them executable.

Also important to note that putting secrets (like your database password) in code is not good practice. For demonstration purposes it's fine here, but in a real life situation you would want to use environment variables or a secure vault (like Hashicorp Vault) to store these.
