response, Firstly, it's important to notice that the complexity of this task mainly relies on how many different platforms your databases are hosted and what kind of platforms they are. Depending on each one, the way to connect and fetch data could change significantly from the one presented here. Without that specific context, I'll provide a solution considering your database is hosted in MySQL and the Python connection will be done using the `pyodbc` (a Python package to connect to ODBC databases).

1. First, install these pip packages via bash.
Install necessary package:

.pip.sh

```sh
#!/bin/bash
pip install -U pip
pip install pyodbc
pip install pandas
```

2. Below is a very simplified example how to connect to the MySQL database and run SELECT queries using pandas (which uses `pyodbc` under the hood).

main.py

```python
import pandas as pd
import pyodbc
import csv

conn_string = (
    r'DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};'
    r'SERVER=mysql;'  # ADJUST THIS
    r'DATABASE=tpch;'  # ADJUST THIS
    r'UID=root;'  # ADJUST THIS
    r'PWD=my-secret-pw'  # ADJUST THIS
)

sql_query = """
SELECT
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
ORDER BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
"""
conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_string)
query_output = pd.read_sql(sql_query, conn)

query_output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
```

Please replace `# ADJUST THIS` with your actual information.

If your database includes multiple tables, or multiple database types, or even data from non-database sources such as text files and web APIs, some data preprocessing steps will be required, which will require Multiple Databases, Tables and SQL joins or pandas.merge operations, therefore, specific information would be required to provide a script that fits your needs.

Also, depending on other factors such as the size of your tables and your machine's specifications, you might consider running your queries directly from your database (preprocessing your data while querying) or your machine (using pandas). Each approach has its own trade-offs and should be considered accordingly.
