response, 1. The Python code (query.py) 

This script uses the mysql-connector-python library to connect to MySQL server and execute SQL queries.

```python
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error
import csv


try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(host='mysql',
                                         database='tpch',
                                         user='root',
                                         password='my-secret-pw')

    if connection.is_connected():
        db_info = connection.get_server_info()
        print("Connected to MySQL Server version ", db_info)

        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT DATABASE();")
        record = cursor.fetchone()
        print("You're connected to database: ", record)

        query = """
        SELECT
            100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)
            ELSE 0
            END) / SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS PROMO_REVENUE
        FROM
            lineitem,
            part
        WHERE
            L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
            AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01'
            AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01'
        """
        cursor.execute(query)
        result = cursor.fetchone()

        with open("query_output.csv", "w") as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow(['PROMO_REVENUE'])
            writer.writerow(result)

except Error as e:
    print("Error while connecting to MySQL", e)

finally:
    if (connection.is_connected()):
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        print("MySQL connection is closed")

```

This Python script will generate a CSV file (query_output.csv) with the result of the query.

2. The bash command file (.sh) to install dependencies:

Please create a file named install.sh with the following command to install python MySQL connector

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

You can run `.sh` script with the following command in the terminal :
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Note: Please ensure that Python and pip are installed in your environment. If not, you can use apt-get (on Ubuntu) or yum (on CentOS) to install Python and pip.

That's it. The dependencies are installed and you are ready to run the python script.

Run the Python script with the following command in terminal:
```bash
python query.py
``` 

Please make sure Python is installed and accessible in your command line before proceeding. If not, please install it.
