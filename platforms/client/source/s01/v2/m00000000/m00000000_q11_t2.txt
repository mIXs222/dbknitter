response, It will be difficult to create Python code that integrates multiple databases and performs operations over them without knowing what those other databases are and what models need to be created for each one. With the given information, I can give you the python code to execute the query over your mysql database.  

1. Create the following python code and save it as connect_mysql.py:
```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

def execute_query():

    # establishing the connection with the mysql server
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', 
                                   host='mysql', database='tpch')

    # preparing a cursor object
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # defining the query
    query = """
            SELECT
                PS_PARTKEY,
                SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) AS VALUE
            FROM
                partsupp,
                supplier,
                nation
            WHERE
                PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY
                AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
                AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'
            GROUP BY
                PS_PARTKEY HAVING
                SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) >
                (
                SELECT
                    SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) * 0.0001000000
                FROM
                    partsupp,
                    supplier,
                    nation
                WHERE
                    PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY
                    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
                    AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'
                )
            ORDER BY
                VALUE DESC
            """
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
    df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index = False)
    
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute_query()
```
To run this python code, type `python connect_mysql.py` in the terminal command line.

2. For installing dependencies and running the python script, you can create a bash file as requirement.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Installing dependencies...."
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas
echo "Dependencies were installed."
echo "Running the python code..."
python connect_mysql.py
echo "Python code ran successfully."
```
To run this bash command, in the terminal command line, type `bash requirements.sh`. Please ensure both files connect_mysql.py and requirements.sh must be in the same directory.

Keep in mind this solution requires Python and pip to be installed on the computer. Also note that this solution requires including the password directly in the Python script, which can be a security issue. A better solution would be to use secrets management software or to set the password as an environment variable.
