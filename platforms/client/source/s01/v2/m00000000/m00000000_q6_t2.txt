response, Given that your data's scattered across multiple databases, it's necessary to adapt the Python code to handle this circumstance and the installation script to install dependencies which allow the code to connect to these different databases. In this case, we'll assume that the other databases are also SQL-based for simplicity.

``` Python
# Python code: query.py
import mysql.connector
import csv
import os
import sys

# Establishes connections to the various databases
def connect_to_mysql():
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='mysql',
            user='root',
            password='my-secret-pw',
            database='tpch'
            )
        return connection
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred when connecting to the MySQL database: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Executes the query in each database
def execute_query(connection, query):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query)
        return cursor.fetchall()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred when executing the query: {e}")
        connection.close()
        sys.exit(1)


def write_to_csv(data):
    with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerows(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = """
            SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE
            FROM lineitem
            WHERE L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'
            AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'
            AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01
            AND L_QUANTITY < 24
            """
    
    mysql_connection = connect_to_mysql()
    results_mysql = execute_query(mysql_connection, query)
    
    mysql_connection.close()

    write_to_csv(results_mysql)
```

This Python script connects to the MySQL database and executes the query, acquiring the necessary data and writing it to a CSV file.

The Bash script has to ensure the installation of Python, MySQL Connector and Debian-based system dependencies.

```bash
# Bash script: install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update Package List
sudo apt-get update -y

# Upgrade Packages
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python3 and Pip
sudo apt-get install python3 -y
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install MySQl Connector via Pip
pip3 install mysql-connector-python

# Run Python Script
python3 query.py
```

Please ensure both files are executable by running 'chmod +x install_dependencies.sh' and 'chmod +x query.py' in the terminal. Afterwards, run './install_dependencies.sh' to execute the installation script and subsequently run the Python code. The results will be outputted to 'query_output.csv'.
