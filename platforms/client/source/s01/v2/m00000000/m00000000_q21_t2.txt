response, Given that it seems we are dealing with only MySQL for now, here's a Python script to run your query. You need the `pymysql` and `pandas` Python libraries to execute it.

Python script (.py):

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql.cursors

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             db='tpch',
                             charset='utf8mb4',
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        sql_query = """
        SELECT
            S_NAME,
            COUNT(*) AS NUMWAIT
        FROM
            supplier,
            lineitem AS L1,
            orders,
            nation
        WHERE
            S_SUPPKEY = L1.L_SUPPKEY
            AND O_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY
            AND O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'
            AND L1.L_RECEIPTDATE > L1.L_COMMITDATE
            AND EXISTS (
                SELECT
                    *
                FROM
                    lineitem AS L2
                WHERE
                    L2.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY
                    AND L2.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY
            )
            AND NOT EXISTS (
                SELECT
                    *
                FROM
                    lineitem AS L3
                WHERE
                    L3.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY
                    AND L3.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY
                    AND L3.L_RECEIPTDATE > L3.L_COMMITDATE
                )
            AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
            AND N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
        GROUP BY
            S_NAME
        ORDER BY
            NUMWAIT DESC,
            S_NAME
        """
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        result = cursor.fetchall()

finally:
    connection.close()

df = pd.DataFrame(result)
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Given that the person running the Python script will need to have pymysql and pandas installed, here's a bash script to install those dependencies using pip:

Bash script (.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pip install pymysql
pip install pandas
```

You can run this bash script in Unix by using the `bash setup.sh` command in the terminal. 

Please remember that in case more platforms are used in future, you would have to have different SQL queries for all platforms and merge the data accordingly in the Python code based on the database type. Also, please do replace all the database connection details with the actual ones in the final code. This is just a mock-up code. Finally, for the bash script please ensure pip is installed, and use `pip3` and `python3` if dealing with Python3.
