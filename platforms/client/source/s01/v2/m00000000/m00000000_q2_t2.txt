response, To execute a query across different platforms, you might use Python libraries like MySQLdb for MySQL and pyodbc for MS SQL etc. Also Python's Pandas library can be used to write the output to a .csv file.

The Python code to execute the SQL query might look something like this:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# Establish a connection to the MySQL database
db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  passwd="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

# Create a cursor object using the cursor() method
cursor = db_connection.cursor()

sql_query = """
SELECT S_ACCTBAL, S_NAME, N_NAME, P_PARTKEY, P_MFGR, S_ADDRESS, S_PHONE, S_COMMENT
FROM part, supplier, partsupp, nation, region
WHERE P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY AND S_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY AND P_SIZE = 15 AND P_TYPE LIKE '%BRASS'
AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY AND R_NAME = 'EUROPE'
AND PS_SUPPLYCOST = (SELECT MIN(PS_SUPPLYCOST) FROM partsupp, supplier, nation, region
WHERE P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY AND S_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY AND R_NAME = 'EUROPE')
ORDER BY S_ACCTBAL DESC, N_NAME, S_NAME, P_PARTKEY
"""

# Execute the SQL command
cursor.execute(sql_query)

# Fetch all the rows in a list of lists and create a pandas dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall())

# Set DataFrame column names
df.columns = [i[0] for i in cursor.description]

# Export the DataFrame to a csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
db_connection.close()
```

To ensure that the required python libraries are installed you could use a bash script similar to this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update -y

# Install pip if not already installed
which pip > /dev/null || { echo installing pip; sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip; }

# List of python packages
python_packages=(
    "mysql-connector-python"
    "pandas"
)

# Install python packages
for package in "${python_packages[@]}"; do
    pip3 install "$package"
done
```
Save that script to a `.sh` file and run it with `sh filename.sh`.

Please adapt the scripts to your exact environment and use cases. For example, if you're not using a Debian-based system, the commands to update package lists and install pip might differ.

Also note that the current solution assumes you're using MySQL. If you're using different database engines, you might need additional/different Python connectors like psycopg2 for PostgreSQL or pyodbc for MS SQL. If you're using a NoSQL database, you'd use entirely different modules and techniques.
