response, One way to approach this problem is to use Python's SQLAlchemy and related libraries.

1. Python code (.py)

We'll divide this into three main parts.

A. Python code to connect to the databases and execute the query 

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

def execute_query():
    db_config = {
        'username': 'root',
        'password': 'my-secret-pw',
        'hostname': 'mysql',
        'database': 'tpch',
    }

    # MySQL
    query = '''
            Your SQL query here
            '''
    mysql_conn_str = f'mysql+pymysql://{db_config["username"]}:{db_config["password"]}@{db_config["hostname"]}/{db_config["database"]}'
    engine = create_engine(mysql_conn_str)
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        result = connection.execute(query)
        df = pd.DataFrame(result.fetchall())
        df.columns = result.keys()

    # Write output to .csv file
    df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute_query()
```

Note: Replace 'Your SQL query here' with the SQL query you provided. 

B. SQL query for MySQL 

```sql
SELECT
    NATION,
    O_YEAR,
    SUM(AMOUNT) AS SUM_PROFIT
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        N_NAME AS NATION,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) - PS_SUPPLYCOST * L_QUANTITY AS AMOUNT
    FROM
        part,
        supplier,
        lineitem,
        partsupp,
        orders,
        nation
    WHERE
        S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY
        AND PS_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY
        AND PS_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
        AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY
        AND P_NAME LIKE '%dim%'
    ) AS PROFIT
GROUP BY
    NATION,
    O_YEAR
ORDER BY
    NATION,
    O_YEAR DESC
```

2. Bash command file (.sh) 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script will install the necessary dependencies

echo "Updating packages"
sudo apt-get update -y  

echo "Installing Python 3 pip"
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y  

echo "Installing necessary Python libraries"
pip3 install sqlalchemy pandas pymysql 

echo "All necessary software has been installed"
```

To run this bash script, you need to navigate to its directory and run `bash install_dependencies.sh` in the terminal.
 
Remember to replace placeholders in your database config and query in the Python script, and make sure to edit your SQL query so it can run on the MySQL database. 

Also, please note the Python script assumes all tables are in the MySQL database. Without specifics about your need to get data from different platforms, I can't provide more detailed advice. If you have multiple databases, you'll have to establish multiple engine connections and modify your SQL queries to match the syntax and table schemas of those databases.
