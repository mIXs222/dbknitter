response, Given the complexity of your question, you have different databases from different platforms, however, you only gave the details of MySQL and your user thinks all databases are MySQL. Without the details of other databases, I can only provide you with a Python code that executes a query on MySQL database and generates a csv file.

Python Code (execute_query.py):

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# create a connection to the database
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

# execute the query
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("""
with revenue0 as
(select
 L_SUPPKEY as SUPPLIER_NO,
 sum(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as TOTAL_REVENUE
 from
 lineitem
 where
 L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01'
 AND L_SHIPDATE < date('1996-01-01', '+3 month')
 group by
 L_SUPPKEY)
select
S_SUPPKEY,
S_NAME,
S_ADDRESS,
S_PHONE,
TOTAL_REVENUE
from
supplier,
revenue0
where
S_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER_NO
and TOTAL_REVENUE = (
 select
 max(TOTAL_REVENUE)
 from
 revenue0
)
order by
S_SUPPKEY
""")

# fetch the results
results = mycursor.fetchall()

# write the output to csv file
df = pd.DataFrame(results)
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Bash file to install dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt update

# Install python3 and pip
sudo apt install python3 -y
sudo apt install python3-pip -y

# Install mysql.connector and pandas
pip3 install mysql-connector-python pandas
```

You can run the bash script with the command `sh install_dependencies.sh`, and run the python script with the python3 execute_query.py command.

Remember to replace the host, user, password and database values in the Python file with your actual MySQL database details. Additionally, you need to replace the SQL query in the Python file with your actual SQL query that you want to execute on your MySQL database.
