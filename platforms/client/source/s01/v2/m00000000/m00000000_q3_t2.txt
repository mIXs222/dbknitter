2. Bash Command File (bash_commands.sh)

These commands assumes you have Python and you are using a debian-based system (like Ubuntu). Depending on your operating system, these package installation commands may vary.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip 
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
sudo apt-get install -y libmysqlclient-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev

python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pandas
python python_code.py
``` 

Make sure python_code.py is located in the same directory where you run this script.

Make "bash_commands.sh" executable by running:
```bash
chmod +x bash_commands.sh
```
then you can execute the .sh file:
```bash
./bash_commands.sh
```
