response, Here's a python script that accomplishes what you described. It assumes the use of Python's `pymysql` and `pandas` libraries:

```python
# Python Code (code.py)

import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Establish a connection to the mysql database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)
cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Execute Query
query = '''
    SELECT
        C_COUNT,
        COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST
    FROM
        (
        SELECT
            C_CUSTKEY,
            COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT
        FROM
            customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON
            C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
            AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'
        GROUP BY
            C_CUSTKEY
        )   C_ORDERS
    GROUP BY
        C_COUNT
    ORDER BY
        CUSTDIST DESC,
        C_COUNT DESC
'''

df = pd.read_sql(query, mysql_conn)

# Write data to csv file
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

For the bash script to install all necessary dependencies, you would have:

```bash
# Bash Commands (setup.sh)

#!/bin/bash

# Install pip if not already installed
if ! command -v pip >/dev/null 2>&1; then 
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    python get-pip.py
    rm get-pip.py
fi

# Install necessary Python packages
pip install pymysql pandas sqlalchemy
```

Please change the host, user, password, and db values to match your actual MySQL database credentials in the Python script above. You can run the python script with the command `python code.py` and the bash script with `sh setup.sh`.
