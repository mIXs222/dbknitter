Bash script to install dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# update the system
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

# Install the MySQL connector for Python
pip3 install mysql-connector-python

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

Save this as 'dependencies.sh' and run it in the terminal using:

```bash
bash dependencies.sh
```

Please note: Python's MySQL connector doesn't support SQLite's strftime function. I've replaced it with MySQL's YEAR function. The two functions are equivalent, but strftime is specific to SQLite.
