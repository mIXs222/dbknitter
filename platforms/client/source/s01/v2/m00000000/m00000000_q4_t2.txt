Bash command file, install_dependencies.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
```

To run the provided Python script, you would execute the following command in a terminal:

```bash
python3 query_mysql.py
```

Note: This Python code assumes that the 'tpch' MySQL database is available on a machine with hostname 'mysql' and that the 'root' user can access it using the password 'my_secret_pw'. If any of these assumptions are not correct, the Python code needs to be adjusted.

For the bash file, if you are using a machine based on a different package manager (not apt-get), you need to replace the 'apt-get' commands with your package manager command. After you assure that, you can run the sh file to install all dependencies by the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```
