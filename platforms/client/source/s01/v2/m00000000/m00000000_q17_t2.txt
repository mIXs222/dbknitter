response, First off, let's write your Python script to execute the query and export to CSV:

Python Code (`query_data.py`):

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

def query_data():
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="mysql",
        user="root",
        password="my-secret-pw",
        database="tpch"
    )

    mycursor = mydb.cursor()

    mycursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY
    FROM
        lineitem,
        part
    WHERE
        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'
        AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'
        AND L_QUANTITY < (
            SELECT
                0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY)
            FROM
                lineitem
            WHERE
                L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
        )
    """)

    result = mycursor.fetchall()
    df = pd.DataFrame(result, columns=['AVG_YEARLY'])

    # save DataFrame to csv
    df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    query_data()
```

Now, for the bash script to install the needed dependencies:

Bash Commands (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package lists for upgrades and new package installations
sudo apt-get update

# Firstly, update Python to the latest version
sudo apt-get upgrade python3

# Install pip, the Python package installer
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

# Now use pip to install the necessary Python packages.
# mysql-connector-python is used to connect our Python script to the MySQL database,
# while pandas and sqlalchemy are used to manipulate the data and write to CSV.
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas sqlalchemy
```

Make sure to give correct permissions to the bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.

**Note:** You will need to run these scripts in an environment where you have the necessary permissions to install software and where MySQL server is accessible. Also, ensure sensitive information like passwords are protected and not publicly accessible. If your tables are in different databases or platforms, you will need to modify the script to connect and query from those different sources. The provided is a general solution for a typical scenario.
