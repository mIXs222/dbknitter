2. Bash Command File to install dependencies:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
pip3 install csv
```

This bash script assumes that you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution, like Ubuntu. The script first updates the package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading, as well as new packages that have just been released. Then it install Python3 and pip3, Pythonâ€™s package installer. After that it uses pip3 to install the `mysql-connector-python` package for connecting to MySQL databases and the `csv` package for writing to CSV files.


Note: 
- Please replace `'my-secret-pw'` with your (the database admin's) actual password in the Python script.
- Depending on database access policies and physical location of the databases, you might need to make certain changes in mysql.connector.connect() parameters.
- Also, ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to execute queries.
