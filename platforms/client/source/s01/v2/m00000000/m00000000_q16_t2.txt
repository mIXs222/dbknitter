response, Here is the python script, using the mysql-connector-python package to connect to your MySQL database and execute the query:

```_python.py
import mysql.connector
import csv

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("""
SELECT
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE,
    COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT
FROM
    partsupp,
    part
WHERE
    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY
    AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'
    AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
    AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
    AND PS_SUPPKEY NOT IN (
        SELECT
            S_SUPPKEY
        FROM
            supplier
        WHERE
            S_COMMENT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
    )
GROUP BY
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE
ORDER BY
    SUPPLIER_CNT DESC,
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE""")

data = mycursor.fetchall()

with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(data)
```

You may run the above python script using this bash command:

```bash.sh
python3 python.py
```

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following bash commands:

```bash_install.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package lists
sudo apt update

# Install python3 and pip3
sudo apt install -y python3 pip3

# Install mysql-connector-python
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
```

Remember to give execution right to the bash file:

```bash
chmod +x bash_install.sh
```

And then run the install script:

```bash
./bash_install.sh
```
