response, Database-agnostic queries is a challenge, you'll need to use some Python libraries that interact with MySQL and MongoDB. Two such libraries are `pymysql` and `pymongo`. 

Python Code:
```python
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import pymysql

# MySQL Connection
mydb = pymysql.connect(
    host="mysql", 
    user="root", 
    passwd="my-secret-pw",
    db="tpch"
)

# MongoDB Connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = client["tpch"]

# Get the needed data from MySQL
mycursor = mydb.cursor()
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM nation, orders")
mysql_result = mycursor.fetchall()

# To make things easier convert it to DataFrame
mysql_df = pd.DataFrame(mysql_result, columns=['N_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME', 'N_REGIONKEY', 'N_COMMENT', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERSTATUS', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'O_CLERK', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY', 'O_COMMENT'])

# Get the needed data from MongoDB
supplier = mongodb.supplier
supplier_data = pd.DataFrame(list(supplier.find()))

customer = mongodb.customer
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(customer.find()))

lineitem = mongodb.lineitem
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem.find()))

# Merge the data together
result = pd.concat([supplier_data, customer_data, lineitem_data, mysql_df], axis=1, join="inner")

# Here you can select the needed columns and filter the data as needed, let's assume the new result is in new_result variable

# save the dataframe to csv
new_result.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

BASH Script (`dependencies.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system
apt update 

# Python and PIP (Python Installer)
apt install python3.8 python3-pip -y

# Python MySQL Library
pip3 install PyMySQL

# Python MongoDB Library
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Permissions for your Python Script
chmod +x your_python_script.py

# Run your Python Script
./your_python_script.py
```

To run the bash file to install the required dependencies, issue the following command in your shell:
```bash
./dependencies.sh
```
These scripts are just examples and you might need to alter them based on your exact system and software configurations. The Python code depends on the exact structure and requirements of your query and may need to be adjusted. Please replace `your_python_script.py` in the bash script with your python script name. You need to adapt and refine the Python code to meet your requirements, it won't work as provided.
