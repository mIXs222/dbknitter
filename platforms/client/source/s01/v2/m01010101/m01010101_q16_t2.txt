response, 1) Python Code (.py)

Make sure to install the pandas, mysql-connector-python, pymongo and csv libraries. If they're not installed use pip to install them.

Here is the code:

```Python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector
import pymongo
import csv

# establish MySQL connection
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

# establish MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]

# MySQL query
mysql_query = '''SELECT
                 P_BRAND,
                 P_TYPE,
                 P_SIZE,
                 COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT
                 FROM
                    partsupp,
                    part
                 WHERE
                    P_PARTKEY = PS_SUPPKEY
                    AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'
                    AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
                    AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)'''

# MongoDB query
mongo_query = { "S_COMMENT": { "$regex": ".*Customer.*Complaints.*" } }

mysql_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, con=mysql_db)
mongo_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.supplier.find(mongo_query)))

# merge
merged_df = mysql_df.loc[~mysql_df.PS_SUPPKEY.isin(mongo_df.S_SUPPKEY)]

# write to file
merged_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

mysql_db.close()
mongo_client.close()
```
Please note that, this python script creates a csv file in the directory it is run from.

2) Bash Command file (.sh) to install required dependencies

Here is the bash script:

```Bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pandas mysql-connector-python pymongo csv
```

Save this as a .sh file and run the bash script to install required dependencies with the following command:

```Bash
sh filename.sh
```

Please note: The accuracy of query output depends on how the MongoDB data is structured and indexed. The query written above is in the simplistic form and does not take into account complex structures with nested arrays or documents. To better accommodate these cases, even using a data processing library such as pandas, the construction of the MongoDB cursor and the transformation to a DataFrame might need customization.
