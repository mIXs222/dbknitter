response, 1. Python Code:

Firstly, prepare your Python environment by installing necessary modules using pip:

```
pip install pandas pymongo mysql-connector-python
```

```python
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# connect to mongodb
client = MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')
db = client.tpch

# load mongodb tables into pandas dataframes
orders = pd.DataFrame(list(db.orders.find()))
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find()))

# merging the mongo db dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(orders, lineitem, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# filtering the merged dataframe
filtered_df = merged_df[(merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) & (merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'] < merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE']) & (merged_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']) & (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') & (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] < '1995-01-01')]

# apply group by and further operations on the filtered dataframe
result_df = filtered_df.groupby('L_SHIPMODE').agg({'O_ORDERPRIORITY': [('HIGH_LINE_COUNT','apply', lambda x: sum((x == '1-URGENT') | (x == '2-HIGH'))), ('LOW_LINE_COUNT','apply', lambda x: sum((x != '1-URGENT') & (x != '2-HIGH')))]})

# write the output to csv file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```
   
2. Bash command file (.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#first navigate to the directory where python code resides
cd /path/to/python/code

# Install the pandas, pymongo and MySQL connector 
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install pandas pymongo mysql-connector-python

#run the python code
python3 your_python_script.py
```

Just simply replace '/path/to/python/code' with your directory where the python script resides.
Also, replace 'your_python_script.py' with the name of your python script.

Give permission to this bash script using:
chmod +x script.sh

And, run this bash script using:
./script.sh

Note: The python code assumes that MongoDB and MySQL data are compatible and same structured. If that's not the case, data cleaning and preprocessing will be required before applying the conditions in the query. 

Also, this python code does not connect to MySQL as per your requirement, as you stated that all data that user thinks is stored in MySQL is actually stored in MongoDB. 

However, If you have MySQL data also and needs to integrate it in this query please let me know. Also, If user credentials for Database access are required add the same while making connection object. This code assumes that the Databases do not require login credentials.
