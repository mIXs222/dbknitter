response, First, we will create two separate python files which will collect data from MySQL and MongoDB and create csv files.

1. get_data_mysql.py:

```
import pymysql
import pandas as pd

con = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
query = """
SELECT N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME, N_REGIONKEY FROM nation
UNION
SELECT R_REGIONKEY, R_NAME FROM region 
UNION
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE FROM part
UNION
SELECT S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL FROM supplier
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, con)
df.to_csv('mysql_data.csv', index=False)
```

2. get_data_mongodb.py:

```
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']

data = pd.DataFrame(list(db.customer.find()))
data.append(pd.DataFrame(list(db.orders.find())))
data.append(pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find())))

data.to_csv('mongodb_data.csv', index=False)
```

Your main python file will combine these csv files and perform your desired operation. But note that the implementation of this main file will depend on the structure of the data of your csv files as well as your requirements.

To install dependencies, you will need a bash (.sh) script.

3. install_dependencies.sh:

```
#!/bin/bash

pip install pymysql pandas pymongo
```

To make the script executable and run it, use:

```
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

One important note is that this is a fairly simplistic approach and doesn't consider some important details such as data security (passwords are written in plain text), error checking, data type compatibility between two different databases, or the fact that the original SQL query given can't be directly applied to the extracted data due to changed structure. It also assumes that MongoDB service is running at port 27017 in MongoDB and MySQL service is running in MySQL host. Also, it doesn't consider the scalability and efficiency for large data. Depending on your actual use case, this solution may need significant improvements.
