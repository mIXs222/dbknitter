response, For this task, you'd need to use pymongo to connect to MongoDB and pandas for data manipulation. Here is a python script that retrieves the data, executes the query and outputs the result to a CSV file.

Python code (data_query.py):
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from pandasql import sqldf

# function to execute SQL query
pysqldf = lambda q: sqldf(q, globals())

# connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]

# convert MongoDB collection to DataFrame
orders = pd.DataFrame(list(db.orders.find()))
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find()))

# Define the SQL query
query = """
        SELECT
            O_ORDERPRIORITY,
            COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT
        FROM
            orders
        WHERE
            O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-07-01'
            AND O_ORDERDATE < '1993-10-01'
            AND EXISTS (
                SELECT
                    *
                FROM
                    lineitem
                WHERE
                    L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
                    AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE
                )
        GROUP BY
            O_ORDERPRIORITY
        ORDER BY
            O_ORDERPRIORITY
        """

# Execute the SQL query
result = pysqldf(query)

# Write to CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Bash command file (.sh) for dependency installation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymongo pandas pandasql
```

To execute the scripts, you can use the following commands on the command-line:

1. First execute the bash script to install dependencies. The bash script should be executable.

```bash
chmod u+x dependency_installation.sh
./dependency_installation.sh
```

2. Then run the python script to query the data and generate the CSV output.

```bash
python data_query.py
```

In addition, please do note that this solution assumes that MongoDB is running on the localhost at the specified port, and the MongoDB collections directly translate to the SQL table structures. If the MongoDB collections have a different structure (for example, in nested documents etc.), additional transformation on the data may be required.
