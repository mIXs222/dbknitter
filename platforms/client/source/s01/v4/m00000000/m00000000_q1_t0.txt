Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS,\n    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,\n    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,\n    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,\n    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,\n    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'\nGROUP BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\nORDER BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested (save as `query_data.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# MySQL database connection information
mysql_config = {
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'host': 'mysql',
    'database': 'tpch'
}

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_config)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
ORDER BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
"""

# Execute the query in MySQL
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)

# Get the results
results = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    # Write the header
    csv_writer.writerow([i[0] for i in mysql_cursor.description])
    # Write data rows
    for row in results:
        csv_writer.writerow(row)

# Close MySQL connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all the dependencies (save as `install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql for Python
pip3 install pymysql
```

Remember to give execute permissions to your Bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
