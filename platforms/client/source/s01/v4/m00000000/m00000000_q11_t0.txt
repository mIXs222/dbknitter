Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Update package list and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql package
pip3 install pymysql
