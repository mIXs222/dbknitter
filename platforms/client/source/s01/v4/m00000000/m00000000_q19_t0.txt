Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Connect to the MySQL server
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

try:
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:

Next is the bash script to install all dependencies necessary to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the pymysql package
pip3 install pymysql
```

To execute these files, you'll need to make the bash script executable and then run it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Python code with the command:

```bash
python3 query.py
```
