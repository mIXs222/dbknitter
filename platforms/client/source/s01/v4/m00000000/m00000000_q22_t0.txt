response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the query on your MySQL database and save the output to `query_output.csv`.

```python
# Python code to execute the SQL query
import pymysql
import csv

# Database connection parameters
db_params = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'database': 'tpch'

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(**db_params)
try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()
        
        # Write the query results to query_output.csv file
        with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as f:
            csv_writer = csv.writer(f)
            # Write headers
            csv_writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])
            # Write data rows
            for row in results:
                csv_writer.writerow(row)
finally:
    connection.close()
```

Save this code to a file, e.g., `execute_query.py`.

Here is the bash script to install all the dependencies required to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash script to install Python and pymysql

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and Python3-pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql for Python using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Save this script to a file, e.g., `install_dependencies.sh`, and don't forget to make it executable by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
