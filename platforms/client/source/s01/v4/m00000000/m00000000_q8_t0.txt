Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

And here is the corresponding bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql for MySQL connectivity
pip3 install pymysql

# Note: Depending on the actual system/environment, additional dependencies
# such as MySQL server/client libraries could be required, but this isn't
# specified in the information provided.
