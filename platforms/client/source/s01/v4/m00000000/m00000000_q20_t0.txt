Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

2. Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
# This installation command works for Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql
```

To execute the bash script, you would typically do the following:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
