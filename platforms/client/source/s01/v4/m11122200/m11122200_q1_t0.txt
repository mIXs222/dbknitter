Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS,\n    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,\n    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,\n    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,\n    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,\n    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'\nGROUP BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\nORDER BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that will execute the query on the MySQL database:

**Python code (query_mysql.py)**

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# MySQL connection details
mysql_config = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch'
}

# Connect to MySQL
connection = pymysql.connect(**mysql_config)

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # SQL query
        sql = """
        SELECT
            L_RETURNFLAG,
            L_LINESTATUS,
            SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
            SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
            AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
            AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
            AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
            COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
        FROM
            lineitem
        WHERE
            L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'
        GROUP BY
            L_RETURNFLAG,
            L_LINESTATUS
        ORDER BY
            L_RETURNFLAG,
            L_LINESTATUS
        """

        cursor.execute(sql)
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write to CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            # Write header
            writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])
            # Write data rows
            for row in result:
                writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    connection.close()
```

Now, let's create a bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

**Bash script (install_dependencies.sh)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade packages
apt-get update
apt-get -y upgrade

# Install pip for Python 3
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python MySQL library (pymysql)
pip3 install pymysql

# Install csv library is part of the Python standard library, so no need to install.
