message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmysql has database named tpch with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mysql:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mysql, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- username: root\n- password: my-secret-pw\n- hostname: mysql\n- instruction: Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    L_SHIPMODE,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY = '1-URGENT'\n            OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS HIGH_LINE_COUNT,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '1-URGENT'\n            AND O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS LOW_LINE_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')\n    AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\nORDER BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

And here is the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) for installing the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL library
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to give the Bash script execution permission:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Run the Bash script to install the dependencies before running the Python script:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
python3 query_execute.py
```
