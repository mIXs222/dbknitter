Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'\n    AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01\n    AND L_QUANTITY < 24\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the given query on the `lineitem` table in the MySQL database:

```python
# file: query_code.py
import pymysql
import csv

# Connection details
connection_details = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
    'charset': 'utf8mb4'
}

# SQL query
query = """
SELECT
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'
    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'
    AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01
    AND L_QUANTITY < 24
"""

# Execute the query and write the results to a CSV file
with pymysql.connect(**connection_details) as connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(query)
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
            csvwriter.writerow(['REVENUE'])
            csvwriter.writerow(result)
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
# file: install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Update and Install Python3 and pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql Python library
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to give the bash script executable permissions using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
