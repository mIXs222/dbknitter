response, Here is the Python code that you requested which will connect to the Redis database, retrieve the `lineitem` table as a pandas DataFrame, execute the SQL-like query using pandas operations, and then save the result as `query_output.csv`.

```python
# redis_query.py
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to Redis
hostname = 'redis'
port = 6379
database_name = '0'  # Redis doesn't use databases the same way SQL does
r = DirectRedis(host=hostname, port=port, db=database_name)

# Load the DataFrame using get()
lineitem = pd.read_json(r.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Perform the same operations as the SQL query using pandas
filtered_data = lineitem[lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1998-09-02']
grouped_data = filtered_data.groupby(['L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS'])

# Perform aggregation
result = grouped_data.agg(SUM_QTY=('L_QUANTITY', 'sum'),
                          SUM_BASE_PRICE=('L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'sum'),
                          SUM_DISC_PRICE=('L_EXTENDEDPRICE', lambda x: (x * (1 - filtered_data.loc[x.index, 'L_DISCOUNT'])).sum()),
                          SUM_CHARGE=('L_EXTENDEDPRICE', lambda x: (x * (1 - filtered_data.loc[x.index, 'L_DISCOUNT']) * (1 + filtered_data.loc[x.index, 'L_TAX'])).sum()),
                          AVG_QTY=('L_QUANTITY', 'mean'),
                          AVG_PRICE=('L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'mean'),
                          AVG_DISC=('L_DISCOUNT', 'mean'),
                          COUNT_ORDER=('L_QUANTITY', 'count'))

# Sort the result
sorted_result = result.sort_values(by=['L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS'])

# Write to CSV
sorted_result.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

Please note, in order for the above python code to work correctly, the appropriate library to handle the `DirectRedis` connection must be installed as it seems to be a custom or third-party Python library not available in the standard library.

For the bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code, assuming you have Python and pip already installed:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install pandas library
pip install pandas

# Install the direct_redis library. Note that if it's not a standard library available through pip,
# this will fail and you'd need to obtain and install it through other means.
pip install direct_redis

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

Make sure to grant execute permissions to the bash script before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

To execute the script, simply run:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

And to run the Python script:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python redis_query.py
deactivate
```

These scripts are a general guide and may require modifications based on your specific environment and how the `DirectRedis` library needs to be obtained.
