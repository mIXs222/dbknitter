Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'\n    AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01\n    AND L_QUANTITY < 24\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (fetch_data.py) to execute the query on your MySQL database:

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# MySQL connection parameters
db_params = {
    'database': 'tpch',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'host': 'mysql',
}

# SQL query
query = """
SELECT
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'
    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'
    AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01
    AND L_QUANTITY < 24
"""

# Establish the database connection
connection = pymysql.connect(**db_params)
try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(query)
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        revenue = result[0] if result else 0

    # Write the output to a CSV file
    with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['REVENUE'])
        writer.writerow([revenue])

finally:
    connection.close()
```

Here's a Bash script (setup.sh) to install the necessary dependencies for the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update -y

# Install Python and pip if not already installed
apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install the pymysql library
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to grant execute permissions to the Bash script before running it:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
