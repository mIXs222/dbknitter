response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on the original data, combining it from the different data platforms:

```python
# python code stored as combined_query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                                   user='root',
                                   password='my-secret-pw',
                                   db='tpch',
                                   cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor)  # Use default cursor, not DictCursor

try:
    with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # Query to get lineitem data
        mysql_query = """
        SELECT
            L_ORDERKEY, L_SHIPMODE
        FROM
            lineitem
        WHERE
            L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')
            AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE
            AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE

            AND L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01'
        """
        cursor.execute(mysql_query)
        lineitem_data = cursor.fetchall()

finally:
    mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client["tpch"]

# Query to get orders data
mongodb_query = {
    "O_ORDERDATE": {
        "$gte": "1994-01-01",
        "$lt": "1995-01-01"
    }
}
orders_data = list(mongodb_db.orders.find(mongodb_query))

# Process and filter orders data into a dictionary keyed by O_ORDERKEY
orders_dict = {order['O_ORDERKEY']: order for order in orders_data}

# Prepare the final result data structure
result = {}

# Combine the data from MySQL and MongoDB
for lineitem in lineitem_data:
    orderkey = lineitem[0]
    shipmode = lineitem[1]

    if orderkey in orders_dict:
        order = orders_dict[orderkey]
        priority = order["O_ORDERPRIORITY"]

        # Create a new entry in the result dictionary if necessary
        if shipmode not in result:
            result[shipmode] = [0, 0]

        # Update high and low line counts
        if priority in ['1-URGENT', '2-HIGH']:
            result[shipmode][0] += 1
        else:
            result[shipmode][1] += 1

# Write output to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['L_SHIPMODE', 'HIGH_LINE_COUNT', 'LOW_LINE_COUNT'])
    
    for shipmode, counts in sorted(result.items()):
        csvwriter.writerow([shipmode] + counts)
```

And here is the bash script to install all the necessary dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
# bash script stored as install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please make sure the files are executable and run the bash script before running the Python script. Remember to correctly configure file permissions, hostnames, and any relevant network settings or credentials that might differ from those given in the question.
