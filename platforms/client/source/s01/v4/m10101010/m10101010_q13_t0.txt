response, Below is the Python code (`execute_query.py`) which connects to the MySQL and MongoDB databases to get the respective data, joins the data in Python, and executes the logic of the SQL query provided. It then outputs the results to `query_output.csv`.

```python
# execute_query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Establishing the MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Establishing the MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Fetching data from MySQL
with mysql_conn:
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT FROM customer")
        customers = cursor.fetchall()

# Fetching data from MongoDB
orders = list(mongodb.orders.find({}, {'_id': 0}))

# Processing data and performing join in Python
def filter_orders(orders, customer_key):
    count = 0
    for order in orders:
        if order['O_CUSTKEY'] == customer_key and 'pending deposits' not in order['O_COMMENT']:
            count += 1
    return count

cust_with_count = [(cust[0], filter_orders(orders, cust[0])) for cust in customers]
cust_count_dict = {}
for cust in cust_with_count:
    cust_count_dict.setdefault(cust[1], 0)
    cust_count_dict[cust[1]] += 1

# Sorting based on the requirements
sorted_cust_count = sorted(cust_count_dict.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], -x[0]))

# Writing to query_output.csv
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['C_COUNT', 'CUSTDIST'])
    for row in sorted_cust_count:
        writer.writerow(row)

# Closing connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install the necessary dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install dependencies script (install_dependencies.sh)

# Make sure system package list is updated
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Upgrade pip to the latest version
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install Python libraries required for the script to run
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please ensure that both these files have execute permissions. To grant execute permissions, you can run the command `chmod +x execute_query.py install_dependencies.sh`.
