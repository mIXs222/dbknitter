Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nwith revenue0 as\n(select\n  L_SUPPKEY as SUPPLIER_NO,\n  sum(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as TOTAL_REVENUE\n  from\n  lineitem\n  where\n  L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01'\n  AND L_SHIPDATE < date('1996-01-01', '+3 month')\n  group by\n  L_SUPPKEY)\nselect\nS_SUPPKEY,\nS_NAME,\nS_ADDRESS,\nS_PHONE,\nTOTAL_REVENUE\nfrom\nsupplier,\nrevenue0\nwhere\nS_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER_NO\nand TOTAL_REVENUE = (\n  select\n  max(TOTAL_REVENUE)\n  from\n  revenue0\n)\norder by\nS_SUPPKEY\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested (`query_executer.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Connect to MySQL database
conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
cur = conn.cursor()

# Write the SQL query
query = """
with revenue0 as
(select
  L_SUPPKEY as SUPPLIER_NO,
  sum(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as TOTAL_REVENUE
  from
  lineitem
  where
  L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01'
  AND L_SHIPDATE < '1996-04-01'
  group by
  L_SUPPKEY)
select
S_SUPPKEY,
S_NAME,
S_ADDRESS,
S_PHONE,
TOTAL_REVENUE
from
supplier,
revenue0
where
S_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER_NO
and TOTAL_REVENUE = (
  select
  max(TOTAL_REVENUE)
  from
  revenue0
)
order by
S_SUPPKEY
"""

# Execute the query
cur.execute(query)

# Fetch all the results
results = cur.fetchall()

# Write results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE', 'TOTAL_REVENUE'])
    for row in results:
        writer.writerow(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

And here is the Bash script you requested to install all dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql
```

To run this script on a Debian-based system, you might need to ensure the script has execute permissions by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` and then execute the script with `./install_dependencies.sh`.
