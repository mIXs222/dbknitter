Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested:

df_lineitem = pd.read_sql(query_lineitem, mysql_connection)

df_revenue = df_lineitem.groupby('L_SUPPKEY')['TOTAL_REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()

# Write revenue DataFrame to SQLite

```

Next, here's the corresponding bash script with all dependency installations:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql, pandas, and sqlalchemy
pip3 install pymysql pandas sqlalchemy

# Install redis-py and direct_redis (assuming direct_redis is available via pip)
pip3 install redis direct_redis
```
Please adjust the last `pip install redis direct_redis` command according to how `direct_redis` is actually supposed to be installed, as it might not be available via PyPI. If `direct_redis` is a custom or private library, you would need to include instructions for its installation. Since I don't have this information, I've made an assumption based on typical Python package installation procedures.
