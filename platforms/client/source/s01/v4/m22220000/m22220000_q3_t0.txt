Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'\n    AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'\nGROUP BY\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nORDER BY\n    REVENUE DESC,\n    O_ORDERDATE\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that executes the query:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import csv

# Establish connection to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

# Prepare the SQL query
sql_query = """
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY
FROM
    customer,
    orders,
    lineitem
WHERE
    C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'
    AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'
    AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY
    L_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY
ORDER BY
    REVENUE DESC,
    O_ORDERDATE
"""

try:
    # Execute the SQL query
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write the result to a CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow(['L_ORDERKEY', 'REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])
            for row in result:
                writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    # Close the database connection
    connection.close()
```

And here's the bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Python 3 and pip (if not already installed)
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Remember to give execution permissions to the bash script before running it with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
