Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY,\n    COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-07-01'\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1993-10-01'\n    AND EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n            AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n        )\nGROUP BY\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY\nORDER BY\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (save this as `execute_query.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # Execute the SQL query
        sql_query = """
            SELECT
                O_ORDERPRIORITY,
                COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT
            FROM
                orders
            WHERE

        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
            csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
            csv_writer.writerow(['O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'ORDER_COUNT'])  # Write header
            for row in result:
                csv_writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    # Close the database connection
    connection.close()
```

And here's the Bash script (save this as `install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
