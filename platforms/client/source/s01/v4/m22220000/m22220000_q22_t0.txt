response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on the MySQL database and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# query_script.py
import pymysql
import csv

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # Execute the SQL query
        cursor.execute("""
        SELECT
            CNTRYCODE,
            COUNT(*) AS NUMCUST,

            ) AS CUSTSALE
        GROUP BY
            CNTRYCODE
        ORDER BY

        """)

        # Fetch the results
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write the results to a CSV file

            for row in results:
                csv_writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    connection.close()
```
And here is the Bash script to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pymysql
