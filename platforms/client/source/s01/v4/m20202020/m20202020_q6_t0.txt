response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on the MySQL database and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# query.py
import csv
import pymysql

# Connection information
conn_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
    'charset': 'utf8mb4'
}

# SQL Query
sql_query = """
SELECT
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'
    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'
    AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01
    AND L_QUANTITY < 24
"""

# Execute the query and write the results to a CSV file
try:
    connection = pymysql.connect(**conn_info)
    with connection:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(sql_query)
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
                writer = csv.writer(file)
                writer.writerow(['REVENUE'])
                writer.writerow(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    connection.close()
```

And here's the bash script to install all the dependencies necessary to run the Python code above:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install.sh
# Make sure to run this script with root privileges

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql via pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Please note that you should run the bash script with sufficient privileges (as root or using sudo) to ensure that it can install the required packages. If you encounter any errors during the installation, you might need to troubleshoot the package manager's errors or potentially modify the script to accommodate the specific configuration of your environment.
