response, Here is the Python code you requested:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)
with mysql_conn:
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(
            """
            SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT
            FROM customer
            """
        )
        customer_records = cursor.fetchall()
        df_customers = pd.DataFrame(customer_records, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 'C_NATIONKEY', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'C_MKTSEGMENT', 'C_COMMENT'])

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders_data = redis_conn.get('orders')
df_orders = pd.read_json(orders_data)

# Prepare dataframe according to the given SQL JOIN query
df_orders_filtered = df_orders[df_orders['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending%deposits%', regex=False)]

# Perform left join
df_merged = pd.merge(df_customers, df_orders_filtered, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')

# Group by C_CUSTKEY and count O_ORDERKEY
grouped = df_merged.groupby('C_CUSTKEY').agg(C_COUNT=('O_ORDERKEY', 'count')).reset_index()

# Further group by C_COUNT and count occurrences
custdist = grouped.groupby('C_COUNT').size().reset_index(name='CUSTDIST')

# Sort the result
custdist_sorted = custdist.sort_values(by=['CUSTDIST', 'C_COUNT'], ascending=[False, False])

# Output to CSV
custdist_sorted.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script for installing the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql direct_redis pandas
```

Please make sure you have the correct hostnames for the MySQL and Redis instances, as well as correct port numbers and any other connection details before running these scripts. Also note that the Python code provided assumes a specific format for the data in Redis, which may require modification to match the actual format of your data.
