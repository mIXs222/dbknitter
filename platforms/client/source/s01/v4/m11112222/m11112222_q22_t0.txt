response, Here's the Python code that attempts to execute the equivalent of your SQL query across the Redis database assuming the `direct_redis` library exists which supports pandas integration:

```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

def query_redis():
    dr = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

    # Use the get method to retrieve the tables as pandas dataframes
    df_customer = dr.get('customer')
    df_orders = dr.get('orders')

    # Perform equivalent operations in pandas for the SQL query provided
    avg_acctbal = df_customer[df_customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.00]['C_ACCTBAL'].mean()
    cntrycode_filter = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
    
    # Filtering customers based on phone and account balance
    filtered_customers = df_customer[
        (df_customer['C_PHONE'].str[:2].isin(cntrycode_filter)) &
        (df_customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > avg_acctbal)
    ].copy()

    # Finding customers without orders
    customers_without_orders = filtered_customers[
        ~filtered_customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(df_orders['O_CUSTKEY'])
    ]

    # Add CNTRYCODE to the filtered customers dataframe
    customers_without_orders['CNTRYCODE'] = customers_without_orders['C_PHONE'].str[:2]

    # Group by the country code, count customers and sum account balances
    result = customers_without_orders.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg(
        NUMCUST=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'),
        TOTACCTBAL=('C_ACCTBAL', 'sum')
    ).reset_index()

    # Write result to csv
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query_redis()
```

And here's a Bash script that installs the dependencies required to run the Python code above:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the repository and install python3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# We don't know the real package necessary to install `direct_redis`, as it's assumed in the question
# Assuming `direct_redis` is a Python package that exists and is available on PyPI
# If it's a custom package, more context would be required to install it correctly

pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct_redis # You need to modify this line if 'direct_redis' is not the real package name
```

Please remember to grant execution permissions to the Bash script after creating it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

*Note:* Since it was not specified, I have made certain assumptions about the APIs of the hypothetical `direct_redis` library based on the Redis and `redis-py` API to translate the SQL logic into equivalent Python pandas operations. In reality, as the exact behavior of `direct_redis` is unknown, some adjustments may be necessary. Additionally, the library or required functionality might not actually exist, in which case you would have to implement your own adapter or connection to handle Redis data using pandas.
