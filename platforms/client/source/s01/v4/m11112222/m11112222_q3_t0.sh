# Install Python and Pip if not already installed
# Note: Python should have been already installed in the system to use 'python3' and 'pip3' commands.

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install python3-pip if not present
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the 'pandas' package
pip3 install pandas

# Assuming 'direct_redis' is a custom module available through some package manager or file distribution
# Since 'direct_redis' is not a standard package, it cannot be installed via pip without the correct source
# For the purpose of this placeholder, we'll assume direct_redis is available as a pip package

pip3 install direct_redis

# After installing dependencies, run the Python code with:
# python3 query_execution.py
