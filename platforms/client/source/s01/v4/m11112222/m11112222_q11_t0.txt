response, Here's the Python code:

**query.py**

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
db = mongo_client.tpch
# Fetch nation and supplier data
nation_data = list(db.nation.find({'N_NAME': 'GERMANY'}))
supplier_data = list(db.supplier.find())

# Convert to DataFrame
df_nation = pd.DataFrame(nation_data)
df_supplier = pd.DataFrame(supplier_data)

# Connect to Redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)
# Fetch partsupp data
partsupp_data = r.get('partsupp')
df_partsupp = pd.read_json(partsupp_data)

# Data transformation: Merge data from MongoDB and partsupp from Redis
df_merged = pd.merge(df_partsupp, df_supplier, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
df_final = pd.merge(df_merged, df_nation, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Perform the calculation
df_grouped = df_final.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').agg(VALUE=('PS_SUPPLYCOST', lambda x: (x*df_final['PS_AVAILQTY']).sum()))
total_value = df_final['PS_SUPPLYCOST'].sum() * df_final['PS_AVAILQTY'].sum() * 0.0001000000
df_grouped = df_grouped[df_grouped['VALUE'] > total_value]
df_grouped = df_grouped.sort_values('VALUE', ascending=False)

# Output result to CSV
df_grouped.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

And here's the Bash script:

**install_dependencies.sh**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MongoDB driver
pip3 install pymongo

# Install direct_redis (assuming it's available on PyPI,
# otherwise, you will need to provide more information)
pip3 install direct_redis

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

Make sure to provide executable permissions for the Bash script before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Please note the assumptions made in the script: 
- It is assumed that `direct_redis` is the correct name of the library to be installed via pip, which may not exist. If it's a proprietary or non-standard library for connecting to Redis, you would need to provide more information or adjust the installation command accordingly.
- The Mongo and Redis clients have been set up with default authentication parameters, assuming no username or password is required. If authentication is required, the connection setup in the Python code should be updated with the necessary credentials.
- The bash script assumes you have the necessary privileges to install software on your system. Depending on the setup, you may need to run the script with `sudo`.
