sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install direct_redis via pip (assuming it is available)
# If it's not available as a package, this would require an alternative installation method
pip3 install direct_redis

# Note:
# The 'direct_redis' package is theoretical and may not exist.
# In practice, Redis does not support retrieving an entire DataFrame directly.
# Therefore, an implementation that fits the user's environment needs to be in place for Redis interactions.
