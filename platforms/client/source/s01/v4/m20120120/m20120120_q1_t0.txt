Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS,\n    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,\n    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,\n    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,\n    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,\n    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'\nGROUP BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\nORDER BY\n    L_RETURNFLAG,\n    L_LINESTATUS\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query.py`) you requested to execute the query on the MySQL database and write the output to `query_output.csv`.

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# MySQL connection parameters
mysql_connection_params = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'database': 'tpch'
}

# SQL query
sql = """
SELECT
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) * (1 + L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
    AVG(L_QUANTITY) AS AVG_QTY,
    AVG(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS AVG_PRICE,
    AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS AVG_DISC,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
ORDER BY
    L_RETURNFLAG,
    L_LINESTATUS
"""

# Connect to MySQL database and execute query
connection = pymysql.connect(**mysql_connection_params)
try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql)
        result = cursor.fetchall()
finally:
    connection.close()

# Write query results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    # Write header
    writer.writerow(['L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS', 'SUM_QTY', 'SUM_BASE_PRICE',
                     'SUM_DISC_PRICE', 'SUM_CHARGE', 'AVG_QTY', 'AVG_PRICE',
                     'AVG_DISC', 'COUNT_ORDER'])
    # Write data rows
    for row in result:
        writer.writerow(row)
```

Next, here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install the required dependencies to run the Python code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to give the Bash script execution permissions using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
