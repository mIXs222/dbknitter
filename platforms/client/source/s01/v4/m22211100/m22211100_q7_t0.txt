response, Here is the Python code that fetches data from the different databases and combines the results to execute the query. This code assumes that you have already installed the required Python libraries (`pymysql`, `pymongo`, and `direct_redis`) and their dependencies, and that they are accessible from the environment where the script will be run.

```python
# python_code.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch nation data from Redis
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('nation'))

# Perform SQL query on MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT
    l.L_ORDERKEY,
    l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    l.L_DISCOUNT,
    l.L_SHIPDATE,
    l.L_SUPPKEY,
    o.O_CUSTKEY
FROM
    lineitem l
JOIN
    orders o ON l.L_ORDERKEY = o.O_ORDERKEY
WHERE
    l.L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31';
"""
lineitem_orders_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_connection)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_connection.close()

# Fetch supplier and customer data from MongoDB
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.supplier.find()))
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.customer.find()))

# Join MongoDB, Redis, and MySQL data
merged_df = (
    lineitem_orders_df
    .merge(supplier_df, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
    .merge(customer_df, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
    .merge(nation_df.rename(columns={'N_NATIONKEY': 'S_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME': 'SUPP_NATION'}), on='S_NATIONKEY')
    .merge(nation_df.rename(columns={'N_NATIONKEY': 'C_NATIONKEY', 'N_NAME': 'CUST_NATION'}), on='C_NATIONKEY')
)

# Filtering for the conditions given in SQL query
filtered_df = merged_df[
    ((merged_df['SUPP_NATION'] == 'JAPAN') & (merged_df['CUST_NATION'] == 'INDIA')) |
    ((merged_df['SUPP_NATION'] == 'INDIA') & (merged_df['CUST_NATION'] == 'JAPAN'))
]

# Adding L_YEAR and VOLUME to the dataframe
filtered_df['L_YEAR'] = pd.to_datetime(filtered_df['L_SHIPDATE']).dt.year
filtered_df['VOLUME'] = filtered_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Grouping and summing VOLUME
output_df = (
    filtered_df
    .groupby(['SUPP_NATION', 'CUST_NATION', 'L_YEAR'])
    .agg(REVENUE=('VOLUME', 'sum'))
    .reset_index()
    .sort_values(by=['SUPP_NATION', 'CUST_NATION', 'L_YEAR'])
)

# Write the output to a CSV file
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the bash script that installs all required dependencies for the above Python code. It uses `pip` for the installation, so ensure that you have Python and `pip` already installed in your environment.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python and Pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis

# Optionally, if you need to install MongoDB and Redis servers
# sudo apt-get install -y mongodb redis-server

# Notes: 
# 1. This script assumes that you are using a Debian/Ubuntu-based system.
# 2. The `sudo` prefix might not be needed if you are running as root.
# 3. The installation of MongoDB and Redis servers is optional as the script does not require running the servers, only the client libraries.
```

Make sure to make the bash script executable by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
