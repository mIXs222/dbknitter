Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY,\n    COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-07-01'\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1993-10-01'\n    AND EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n            AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n        )\nGROUP BY\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY\nORDER BY\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

For the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

This script assumes you are running it on a Debian-based system with `apt` package manager and that Python3 and pip are already installed on your system. If they're not already present, you might need to install Python3 and pip first. Please note that running the `install_dependencies.sh` script requires administrative privileges to use the `sudo` command for installations.
