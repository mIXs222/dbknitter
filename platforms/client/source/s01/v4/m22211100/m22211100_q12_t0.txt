Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    L_SHIPMODE,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY = '1-URGENT'\n            OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS HIGH_LINE_COUNT,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '1-URGENT'\n            AND O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS LOW_LINE_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')\n    AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\nORDER BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
