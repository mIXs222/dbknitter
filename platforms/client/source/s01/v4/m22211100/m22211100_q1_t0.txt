Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_connection_info)

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(sql_query)
result = cursor.fetchall()

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:

Now, here's the corresponding Bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Ensure pip is installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql
