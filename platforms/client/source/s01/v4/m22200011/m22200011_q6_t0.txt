response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on MongoDB:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# Connect to the MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client.tpch

# Define the pipeline for the aggregation
pipeline = [
    {
        "$match": {
            "L_SHIPDATE": {
                "$gte": "1994-01-01",
                "$lt": "1995-01-01"
            },
            "L_DISCOUNT": {
                "$gte": .05,
                "$lte": .07
            },
            "L_QUANTITY": {
                "$lt": 24
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": None,
            "REVENUE": {
                "$sum": {
                    "$multiply": ["$L_EXTENDEDPRICE", "$L_DISCOUNT"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
]

# Perform the aggregation
result = db.lineitem.aggregate(pipeline)

# Write the output to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["REVENUE"])  # Headers

    for doc in result:
        writer.writerow([doc["REVENUE"]])
```

And here is the Bash script to install all necessary dependencies to run the above Python code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the repositories
apt-get update

# Upgrade packages
apt-get upgrade -y

# Install MongoDB
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | apt-key add -
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
apt-get update
apt-get install -y mongodb-org

# Start the MongoDB service
service mongod start

# Install python pip
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymongo through pip
pip3 install pymongo
```
Please save this script as a `.sh` file and execute it on a Unix-based system to install the dependencies. Note that you may need superuser privileges to run the installation commands, and you may need to adjust some commands depending on the specific Linux distribution or the MongoDB version you are working with.
