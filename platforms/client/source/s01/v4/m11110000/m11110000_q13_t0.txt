Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on the original data (`.py` file):

```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Connection details
db_config = {
    "host": "mysql",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "db": "tpch",
}

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(**db_config)

# SQL query
sql_query = """
SELECT
    C_COUNT,
    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        C_CUSTKEY,
        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT
    FROM
        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON
        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'
    GROUP BY
        C_CUSTKEY
    ) C_ORDERS
GROUP BY
    C_COUNT
ORDER BY
    CUSTDIST DESC,
    C_COUNT DESC
"""

# Execute the query
try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write query output to csv file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            # Write header
            csv_writer.writerow(['C_COUNT', 'CUSTDIST'])
            # Write data
            for row in results:
                csv_writer.writerow(row)
finally:
    connection.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run that Python code (`.sh` file):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
