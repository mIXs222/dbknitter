Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```sql\n\nSELECT\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY,\n    COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-07-01'\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1993-10-01'\n    AND EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n            AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n        )\nGROUP BY\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY\nORDER BY\n    O_ORDERPRIORITY\n\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the given SQL query across the MySQL database:

```python
# query.py

    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'database': 'tpch'
}

# Establish connection to MySQL instance
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host=db_info['host'],
    user=db_info['user'],
    password=db_info['password'],
    database=db_info['database']
)

# Prepare the SQL query
query = """

    COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT

# Execute the SQL query
with conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()

# Write the output to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:

```

The bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package manager
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if they aren't already installed
apt-get install -y python3
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Make sure to grant execute permissions to the bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
