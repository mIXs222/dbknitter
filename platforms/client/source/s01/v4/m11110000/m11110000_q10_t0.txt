response, Here is the Python code (query_execute.py) that you requested, which will execute the given SQL query by fetching data from both MySQL and MongoDB and combining the results:

```python

mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch', charset='utf8mb4')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
nation_collection = mongo_db['nation']

# Get nation data from MongoDB
nation_data = {}
for nation in nation_collection.find():
    nation_data[nation['N_NATIONKEY']] = nation['N_NAME']

# SQL Query for MySQL execution
mysql_query = """

try:

    with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)

            n_name = nation_data.get(row[7]) 
            if n_name:
                writer.writerow(row[:-1] + (n_name,))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    mysql_cursor.close()
    mysql_conn.close()
    mongo_client.close()
```

This code assumes that the MongoDB 'nation' collection's documents have keys exactly matching the SQL-like schema specified (e.g., `N_NATIONKEY` instead of `n_nationkey`. If the actual schema uses lowercase or different keys, the code that accesses `nation['N_NATIONKEY']` and `nation['N_NAME']` would need to be adjusted accordingly.

And here is the bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and Pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please run this bash script with root privileges to install the necessary dependencies. Note that this script is written for Debian-based systems, such as Ubuntu. If using a different Linux distribution, the package management commands may need to be adjusted accordingly.
