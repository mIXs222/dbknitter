response, Here is the required Python code:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def execute_query():
    # Connection information for Redis
    redis_host = 'redis'
    redis_port = 6379
    redis_db = 0

    # Establish the connection to the Redis database
    redis_conn = DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)

    # Get the 'lineitem' DataFrame from Redis
    lineitem = pd.read_msgpack(redis_conn.get('lineitem'))

    # Filtering the lineitem DataFrame according to the SQL WHERE clause
    filtered_lineitem = lineitem[
        (lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'] >= pd.Timestamp('1994-01-01')) &
        (lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'] < pd.Timestamp('1995-01-01')) &
        (lineitem['L_DISCOUNT'] >= (.06 - 0.01)) &
        (lineitem['L_DISCOUNT'] <= (.06 + 0.01)) &
        (lineitem['L_QUANTITY'] < 24)
    ]

    # Calculating the REVENUE as per the SQL SELECT clause
    result = pd.DataFrame({
        'REVENUE': [(filtered_lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * filtered_lineitem['L_DISCOUNT']).sum()]
    })

    # Writing the results to query_output.csv
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    execute_query()
```

And here is the bash script to install all the necessary dependencies:

```sh
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install pip, the package installer for Python
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Make sure we have the latest version of pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install Pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis which is needed for connecting to Redis store
pip3 install direct-redis
```

Copy each of these scripts to their own `.py` and `.sh` files respectively, and then you can run the bash script to install dependencies followed by the python code to execute your query. Make sure that both of these scripts are executable by running `chmod +x` on each of them.
