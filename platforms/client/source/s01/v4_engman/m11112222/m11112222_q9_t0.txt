The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code that performs the necessary operations:

```python
# python code to execute the query (save as execute_query.py)

from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import redis as rd


def get_mongodb_data():
    client = MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
    db = client.tpch
    
    nation = pd.DataFrame(list(db.nation.find({}, {"_id": 0})))
    supplier = pd.DataFrame(list(db.supplier.find({}, {"_id": 0})))
    
    client.close()
    return nation, supplier


def get_redis_data():
    redis_client = rd.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)
    partsupp = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('partsupp'))
    lineitem = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))
    
    return partsupp, lineitem


def main():
    # Connect to MongoDB and get data
    nation, supplier = get_mongodb_data()

    # Connect to Redis and get data
    partsupp, lineitem = get_redis_data()

    # Now we need to merge and compute the results according to the specified query
    # Step 1: Merge dataframes to have all required data in one dataframe
    merged_df = (
        lineitem
        .merge(partsupp, how='left', on=['PS_PARTKEY', 'PS_SUPPKEY'])
        .merge(supplier, how='left', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
        .merge(nation, how='left', left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
    )

    # Step 2: Calculate the profit as per the given formula
    merged_df['PROFIT'] = (merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])) - (merged_df['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * merged_df['L_QUANTITY'])
    
    # Step 3: Group by N_NAME and L_SHIPDATE (extracted year), and then calculate total profit
    merged_df['YEAR'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(merged_df['L_SHIPDATE']).year
    result = (
        merged_df
        .groupby(['N_NAME', 'YEAR'])
        .agg({'PROFIT': 'sum'})
        .reset_index()
    )

    # Step 4: Sort results as per requirements
    result = result.sort_values(['N_NAME', 'YEAR'], ascending=[True, False])
    
    # Write result to CSV
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now let's create the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save this as install_dependencies.sh

# Update packages and install Python and Pip if they're not already installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis
```

Make sure to give the bash script execute permission using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it, and to execute it with the appropriate user permissions, as it uses `sudo`.
