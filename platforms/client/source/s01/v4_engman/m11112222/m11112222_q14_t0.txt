The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to retrieve and combine data from the MongoDB and Redis databases to execute the described query:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py

import pymongo
from bson.json_util import loads
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
client_mongo = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db_mongo = client_mongo["tpch"]

# Get the 'part' collection from MongoDB
part_col = db_mongo["part"]

# Fetch the data from 'part' collection for promotional parts
promotional_parts = list(part_col.find({}, {"_id": 0}))

# Convert to DataFrame
df_parts = pd.DataFrame(promotional_parts)

# Connect to Redis
client_redis = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the 'lineitem' data from Redis
lineitem_data = client_redis.get('lineitem')

# Convert JSON string to pandas DataFrame
df_lineitem = pd.read_json(loads(lineitem_data))

# Filter the lineitem DataFrame for the specified date range
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 10, 1)
df_lineitem = df_lineitem[(df_lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) & (df_lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'] < end_date)]

# Join parts and lineitems DataFrames on P_PARTKEY and L_PARTKEY
df_result = pd.merge(df_lineitem, df_parts, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate the revenue
df_result['revenue'] = df_result['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - df_result['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate the total revenue
total_revenue = df_result['revenue'].sum()

# Calculate the revenue from promotional parts
promotional_revenue = df_result[df_result['P_TYPE'].str.contains('PROMO')]['revenue'].sum()

# Calculate the promotion effect percentage
promotion_effect_percentage = (promotional_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Prepare the output
output_data = {'promotion_effect_percentage': promotion_effect_percentage}

# Write to csv file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(output_data.keys())
    writer.writerow(output_data.values())

print(f"The promotion effect percentage for the given date range is: {promotion_effect_percentage}%")
```

Below is the bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code above:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update and install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, direct_redis, and pandas
pip3 install pymongo direct_redis pandas
```

Make sure both the Python script and the bash script are executable and run the bash script before the Python script. Ensure that the IP addresses or hostname, port, and database names in the Python script match your actual MongoDB and Redis setup.
