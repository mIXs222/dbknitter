# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and pymsgpack (required for direct_redis)
pip3 install pymongo pandas pymsgpack

# Since direct_redis isn't a standard package available on PyPI,
# we would normally install it manually
# Unfortunately, without further details about this package, we cannot provide
# installation commands. If it's available in a git repository, you might use:
# git clone <repository_url>
# cd <cloned_repository>
# pip3 install .

# For demonstration purposes, we act as if it's installable via pip
pip3 install direct_redis
