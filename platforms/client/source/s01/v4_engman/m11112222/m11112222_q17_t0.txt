What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?

Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's your Python code (`query_exec.py`):

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
parts_collection = mongo_db["part"]

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)

# Get the relevant parts from MongoDB
part_query = {"P_BRAND": "BRAND#23", "P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG"}
part_projection = {"P_PARTKEY": 1}
relevant_parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(parts_collection.find(part_query, part_projection)))

# Get lineitem data from Redis as a DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.read_msgpack(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

# Join on partkey to filter relevant lineitems
combined_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(relevant_parts_df['P_PARTKEY'])]

# Calculate the average quantity of small quantity orders
avg_quantity = combined_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()
small_quantity_orders = combined_df[combined_df['L_QUANTITY'] < avg_quantity * 0.2]

# Calculate average yearly gross loss
small_quantity_orders['GROSS_LOSS'] = small_quantity_orders['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - small_quantity_orders['L_DISCOUNT'])
average_yearly_loss = small_quantity_orders['GROSS_LOSS'].sum() / 7

# Write the output
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'Average_Yearly_Loss': [average_yearly_loss]})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's your Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and pymsgpack (required for direct_redis)
pip3 install pymongo pandas pymsgpack

# Since direct_redis isn't a standard package available on PyPI,
# we would normally install it manually
# Unfortunately, without further details about this package, we cannot provide
# installation commands. If it's available in a git repository, you might use:
# git clone <repository_url>
# cd <cloned_repository>
# pip3 install .

# For demonstration purposes, we act as if it's installable via pip
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Ensure `install_dependencies.sh` has execute permissions by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`. Then you can execute it to install all required dependencies.
