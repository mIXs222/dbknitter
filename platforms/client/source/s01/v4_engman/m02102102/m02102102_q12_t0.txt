We only consider line items that are actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the l_receiptdate should exceeds the l_commitdate, the ship mode should be in 'mail' or 'ship'. Also, only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The output results are grouped and ordered by l_shipmode in ascending order. For each group, we also count the number of lineitems of high order priority (those with priority URGENT or HIGH), and the number of lineitems of low order priority  (with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query across the different databases:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd

with mysql_conn.cursor() as mysql_cursor:
    # Query to select orders from MySQL database with high priority
    mysql_query = """
    SELECT O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERPRIORITY 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE O_ORDERPRIORITY = 'URGENT' OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = 'HIGH'
    """
    mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    high_priority_orders = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Preparing a data frame for high priority orders
high_priority_df = pd.DataFrame(high_priority_orders, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY'])

# Connecting to the Redis database
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieving lineitem data from Redis and loading into a DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(redis_conn.get('lineitem'))
lineitem_df.columns = ['L_ORDERKEY', 'L_PARTKEY', 'L_SUPPKEY', 'L_LINENUMBER', 'L_QUANTITY',

# Joining both datasets on orderkey
merged_df = pd.merge(filtered_lineitem_df, high_priority_df, how='left', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Adding a column to identify high and low priority lineitems
merged_df['PRIORITY_TYPE'] = merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].apply(lambda x: 'HIGH' if x in ['URGENT', 'HIGH'] else 'LOW')

# Grouping the results by L_SHIPMODE and PRIORITY_TYPE, then counting
result = merged_df.groupby(['L_SHIPMODE', 'PRIORITY_TYPE']).size().reset_index(name='COUNT')

# Saving the results to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the database connections
mysql_conn.close()
```

Below is the Bash script to install necessary dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
