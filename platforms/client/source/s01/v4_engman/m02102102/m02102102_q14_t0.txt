response, Here is the Python code (query.py) that retrieves data from both MongoDB and Redis and calculates the promotional effect:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']
parts_collection = db['part']

# Fetch parts data
parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(parts_collection.find(
    {"P_NAME": {"$regex": ".*PROMO.*"}},
    {"_id": 0, "P_PARTKEY": 1}
)))

# Redis connection
r = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(r.get('lineitem'))

# Convert data types for calculation
lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'] = lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].astype(int)
lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].astype(float)
lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'] = lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'].astype(float)
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])

# Filter date range for line items shipped
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 10, 1)
filtered_lineitems = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < end_date)
]

# Join on part key to find promotional items
promo_lineitems = pd.merge(filtered_lineitems, parts_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate revenue
promo_lineitems['REVENUE'] = promo_lineitems['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - promo_lineitems['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate total revenue and promotional revenue
total_revenue = filtered_lineitems['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_lineitems['L_DISCOUNT']).sum()
promo_revenue = promo_lineitems['REVENUE'].sum()

# Calculate percentage of promotional revenue
promo_percentage = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue else 0

# Write to CSV file
output_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Promotional_Revenue_Percentage': [promo_percentage]
})
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies needed to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Make sure to give the script executable permissions by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` in the terminal before executing it. Also note that these scripts need to be run in an environment where MongoDB and Redis are accessible at the specified hostnames 'mongodb' and 'redis', respectively.
