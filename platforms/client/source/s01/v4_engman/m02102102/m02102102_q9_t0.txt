The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code required to execute the task mentioned:

```python
# profits_query.py
import csv
import datetime
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Querying MySQL database for relevant tables
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM nation")
    nations = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM supplier")
    suppliers = cursor.fetchall()

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(
    host='mongodb',
    port=27017
)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
part_collection = mongo_db['part']

# Querying MongoDB for part table
parts = list(part_collection.find({}))

mysql_conn.close()

# Redis connection and query setup
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Reading data from Redis
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('partsupp'))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'))

# Calculate profit for each line
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, partsupp_df, how='inner', on=['L_PARTKEY', 'L_SUPPKEY'])
merged_df['profit'] = (merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])) - (merged_df['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * merged_df['L_QUANTITY'])

# Filtering parts with a specified dimension in their names (example: 'dim')
# Assuming 'specified_line' is a user-given input for filtering parts
specified_line = 'dim'
filtered_parts = [part for part in parts if specified_line in part['P_NAME']]

# Filter merged_df for relevant parts only
filtered_df = merged_df[merged_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin([part['P_PARTKEY'] for part in filtered_parts])]

# Aggregate profit by nation and year
profits = (
    filtered_df
    .groupby(['L_SUPPKEY', filtered_df['L_SHIPDATE'].dt.year])
    .agg({'profit': 'sum'})
    .reset_index()
)
profits = pd.merge(profits, nations, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Final output: sorting and selecting relevant columns
final_output = profits.sort_values(['N_NAME', 'L_SHIPDATE'], ascending=[True, False])[['N_NAME', 'L_SHIPDATE', 'profit']]

# Writing results to CSV
final_output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is a bash script with the necessary commands to install the dependencies required by the provided Python script:

```bash
# setup.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Update package list and install pip if not available
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas
```

Make sure to give execute permissions to the bash script file by running:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Before executing it with:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

Then you can run the Python script:
```bash
python3 profits_query.py
```
