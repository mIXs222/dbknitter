This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to fulfill the request, saved as `query_code.py`:
```python

    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
    charset='utf8mb4'
)

# MongoDB connection
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Fetching customer IDs from MongoDB
customer_ids = mongodb_db.customer.distinct("C_CUSTKEY")

# Processing the query with MySQL
order_query = """
SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) as order_count

GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
HAVING O_CUSTKEY IN ({})

# Formatting the customer_ids for SQL query
customer_ids_sql = ', '.join(str(id) for id in customer_ids)

# Executing the query
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(order_query.format(customer_ids_sql))
    order_results = cursor.fetchall()

# Writing results to CSV file
