It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's a Python script (`execute_query.py`) that performs the described operation:

```python
import csv
import pymysql
import pymongo
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Process customers in MongoDB and gather relevant data
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
seven_years_ago = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=7*365)
mongo_customers = mongodb['customer'].find(
    {"C_PHONE": {"$regex": "^(?:" + "|".join(country_codes) + ")"},
     "C_ACCTBAL": {"$gt": 0}}
)
average_balance = {}
customer_data = {}

for cust in mongo_customers:
    country_code = cust['C_PHONE'][:2]
    customer_key = cust['C_CUSTKEY']
    if country_code not in average_balance:
        average_balance[country_code] = {'total': 0, 'count': 0}
        customer_data[country_code] = {'count': 0, 'total_balance': 0}

    average_balance[country_code]['total'] += cust['C_ACCTBAL']
    average_balance[country_code]['count'] += 1

    customer_data[country_code]['count'] += 1
    customer_data[country_code]['total_balance'] += cust['C_ACCTBAL']

# Get the average balances greater than 0 and exclude customers with orders in the last 7 years from MySQL
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    for cc in country_codes:
        if cc in average_balance and average_balance[cc]['count'] > 0:
            avg_bal = average_balance[cc]['total'] / average_balance[cc]['count']
            cursor.execute(
                "SELECT o.O_CUSTKEY FROM orders o WHERE o.O_ORDERDATE >= %s AND o.O_CUSTKEY in ("
                "SELECT c.C_CUSTKEY FROM customer c WHERE c.C_PHONE LIKE %s)",
                (seven_years_ago, cc + '%')
            )
            active_customers = cursor.fetchall()
            active_customer_keys = {row[0] for row in active_customers}
            
            # Exclude active customers
            for active_cust_key in active_customer_keys:
                if active_cust_key in customer_data[cc]['count']:
                    customer_data[cc]['total_balance'] -= active_cust_key
                    customer_data[cc]['count'] -= 1

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['CNTRYCODE', 'CUSTOMER_COUNT', 'TOTAL_BALANCE']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    for code in sorted(customer_data.keys()):
        row = {
            'CNTRYCODE': code,
            'CUSTOMER_COUNT': customer_data[code]['count'],
            'TOTAL_BALANCE': customer_data[code]['total_balance']
        }
        writer.writerow(row)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here's the associated Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and PIP if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL and PyMongo using PIP
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please make sure to give execution permission to the bash script after creating it by using the command `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`.
