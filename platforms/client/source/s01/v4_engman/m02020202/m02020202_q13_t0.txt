This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code (.py):

```python
# query_execution.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch',
)

# Query MySQL for orders
orders_query = """
SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) as num_orders 
FROM orders 
WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS NOT LIKE '%pending%' 
AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%deposits%' 
GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY;
"""
orders_df = pd.read_sql(orders_query, mysql_connection)
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('customer'))

# Merge data on customer key
merged_df = customer_df.merge(orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='inner')

# Group by number of orders and count number of customers
result = merged_df.groupby('num_orders').size().reset_index(name='num_customers')

# Save to csv
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the requested Bash script (.sh) for installing dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and PIP if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python libraries required for the script
pip install pymysql pandas direct-redis
