All the considered orders should have total quantity of larger than 300. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. And the result is order by O_TOTALPRICE in descending and O_ORDERDATE in ascending.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you requested (saved as `query_code.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Execute the query on the orders table in MySQL
mysql_query = """
    SELECT O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_TOTALPRICE
    FROM orders
    WHERE O_ORDERKEY IN (
        SELECT L_ORDERKEY
        FROM lineitem
        GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY
        HAVING SUM(L_QUANTITY) > 300
    )
"""
mysql_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis database
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the customer and lineitem dataframes from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('customer'))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

# Perform the join operation and filtering
result_df = (
    mysql_df.merge(customer_df, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
    .merge(lineitem_df[['L_ORDERKEY', 'L_QUANTITY']], left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')
)

# Filter orders with total quantity larger than 300
result_df = result_df.groupby(['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE']).filter(
    lambda x: x['L_QUANTITY'].sum() > 300
)

# Select necessary columns
result_df = result_df[['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE']]

# Order by total price descending, order date ascending
result_df = result_df.sort_values(by=['O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])

# Write result to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies (saved as `install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql pandas redis direct-redis
```

Please note that this script assumes you have `pip` installed on your system and it is the correct package manager for your Python environment. You might need to adapt it if you are using a different package manager or Python environment.
