The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.

Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on your original data from different data platforms:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv

# Establish connection to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                                   user='root',
                                   password='my-secret-pw',
                                   database='tpch')

# Construct query for MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT 
    O_ORDERPRIORITY, 
    COUNT(*) as ORDER_COUNT
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-07-01' AND O_ORDERDATE < '1993-10-01'
GROUP BY 
    O_ORDERPRIORITY
ORDER BY 
    O_ORDERPRIORITY ASC;
"""

# Read data from MySQL
orders_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_connection)

# Close the MySQL connection
mysql_connection.close()

# Establish connection to Redis
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read data from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(redis_connection.get('lineitem')))

# Close the Redis connection
redis_connection.close()

# Perform the main query logic
filtered_lineitem = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE'] < lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE']]
joined_data = filtered_lineitem.merge(orders_df, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY', how='inner')

result = joined_data.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY', as_index=False).agg({'O_ORDERKEY':'nunique'}).rename(columns={'O_ORDERKEY':'ORDER_COUNT'}).sort_values('O_ORDERPRIORITY')

# Write the result to file
result[['ORDER_COUNT', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY']].to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies necessary to run the Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install -y python3

# Install pip (you might not need this if you already have pip installed)
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# Since 'direct_redis' isn't a standard package, you may need to acquire it from the proper
# source or repository. Assuming it exists in the Python Package Index, you may use pip to install.
# Otherwise, you must follow the correct installation procedure.
pip3 install direct_redis
```
Please ensure that you have the correct permissions to execute the bash script and that your system is compatible with these commands. You might also want to consider using a virtual environment for Python to avoid conflicts with existing packages.
