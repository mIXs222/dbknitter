This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. The Python code (query.py):

```python
import pymysql
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# Getting current date to calculate 7 years ago
current_date = datetime.now()
seven_years_ago = current_date - timedelta(days=7*365)

# MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT O_CUSTKEY
FROM orders
WHERE O_ORDERDATE <= '{}';
""".format(seven_years_ago.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Execute the query
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    # Fetch all customers who have placed orders within 7 years
    customers_with_orders = set(row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall())

# Close the connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Extract customer data from Redis and convert to Pandas DataFrame
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('customer'))

# Filter customer data according to the conditions
country_codes = ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
filtered_customers = customer_data[
    (customer_data['C_CUSTKEY'].apply(lambda x: x not in customers_with_orders)) &  # no orders in the last 7 years
    (customer_data['C_PHONE'].str[:2].isin(country_codes)) &  # one of the specified country codes
    (customer_data['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.00)  # account balance larger than 0.00
]

# Calculate average account balance for those countries
average_balance = filtered_customers['C_ACCTBAL'].mean()

# Further filter according to account balance above average
final_customers = filtered_customers[filtered_customers['C_ACCTBAL'] > average_balance]

# Group by the first two characters of C_PHONE and perform the necessary calculations
output = final_customers.groupby(filtered_customers['C_PHONE'].str[:2]).agg({
    'C_CUSTKEY': 'count',
    'C_ACCTBAL': 'sum'
}).reset_index()

output.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'NUM_CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL_ACCTBAL']

# Write to CSV

# Update package list and install Python and pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymysql direct_redis pandas
