The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that fulfills the request:

```python
# import_libraries.py
import csv
import pymysql
import pymongo

# Connect to MySQL (supplier and partsupp tables)
conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
cur = conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB (nation table)
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
nation_collection = mongodb['nation']

# Find nationkey for GERMANY
germany_nationkey = nation_collection.find_one({'N_NAME': 'GERMANY'})['N_NATIONKEY']

# Execute query for partsupp and supplier tables in MySQL
cur.execute("""SELECT PS_PARTKEY, SUM(PS_AVAILQTY * PS_SUPPLYCOST) AS value 
               FROM partsupp 
               JOIN supplier ON PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY 
               WHERE S_NATIONKEY = %s 
               GROUP BY PS_PARTKEY 
               HAVING SUM(PS_AVAILQTY * PS_SUPPLYCOST) > 0.0001 
               ORDER BY value DESC""", (germany_nationkey,))

results = cur.fetchall()

# Write query result to file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['PS_PARTKEY', 'VALUE'])  # header
    for row in results:
        csvwriter.writerow(row)

# Close the database connections
cur.close()
conn.close()
client.close()
```

And here is the bash script for installing the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and install python3-pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install pymongo
