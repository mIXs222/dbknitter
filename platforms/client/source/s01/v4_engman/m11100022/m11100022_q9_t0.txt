The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results).
