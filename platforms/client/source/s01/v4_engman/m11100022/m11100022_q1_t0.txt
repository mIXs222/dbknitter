Please note, Python generally doesn't communicate directly with Redis in the way the question suggests (using Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`). However, based on the constraints given, I'm providing the following Python script using a hypothetical `direct_redis` module.

```python
import pandas as pd
import csv
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to Redis
redis_host = "redis"
redis_port = 6379
redis_db = 0

redis_client = DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)

# Retrieve data from Redis
lineitem_df = redis_client.get('lineitem')

# Convert the ship date column to datetime
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])

# Apply the date filter before generating the report
date_filter = lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < "1998-09-02"
filtered_df = lineitem_df[date_filter]

# Calculate aggregates
report_df = filtered_df.groupby(['L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS']).agg(
    TOTAL_QUANTITY=('L_QUANTITY', 'sum'),
    TOTAL_EXTENDEDPRICE=('L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'sum'),
    TOTAL_DISCOUNTPRICE=lambda x: (x['L_QUANTITY'] * x['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - x['L_DISCOUNT'])).sum(),
    TOTAL_DISCOUNTED_PRICE_PLUS_TAX=lambda x: (x['L_QUANTITY'] * x['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - x['L_DISCOUNT']) * (1 + x['L_TAX'])).sum(),
    AVG_QUANTITY=('L_QUANTITY', 'mean'),
    AVG_EXTENDED_PRICE=('L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'mean'),
    AVG_DISCOUNT=('L_DISCOUNT', 'mean'),
    COUNT_ORDER=('L_ORDERKEY', 'count')
).reset_index()

# Sort the result
sorted_report_df = report_df.sort_values(by=['L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS'])

# Write the result to a CSV file
sorted_report_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
```

2. Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Python and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pandas redis
```

Please note that the `direct_redis` module does not exist in the standard library or known third-party Python packages, so I assumed it is a custom or proprietary package that you already have available in your environment. You would need to install this package in addition to other dependencies mentioned above to run the python script successfully. The bash script provided above only installs the general dependencies and assumes `direct_redis` is already available in your Python environment.
