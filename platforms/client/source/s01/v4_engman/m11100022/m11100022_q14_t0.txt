The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code: `query_code.py`

```python
# query_code.py
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']
part_collection = mongodb['part']

# Query to retrieve parts that are considered promotional
promotional_parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part_collection.find({})))

# Redis connection
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_df = redis_client.get('lineitem')

if lineitem_df is not None:
    # Convert the Redis response to DataFrame and filter the dates
    lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(lineitem_df), index=[0])
    lineitem_df = lineitem_df[(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1995-09-01') & (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1995-10-01')]
    
    # Inner join with promotional parts on part key
    combined_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, promotional_parts_df, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
    
    # Calculating revenue
    combined_df['REVENUE'] = combined_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - combined_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

    # Calculate the total revenue from promotional parts
    total_revenue = combined_df['REVENUE'].sum()

    # Calculate the total revenue across all parts
    total_market_revenue = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
    total_market_revenue = total_market_revenue.sum()

    # Calculate the percentage of revenue from promotional parts
    promo_revenue_percentage = (total_revenue / total_market_revenue) * 100 if total_market_revenue else 0

    # Create a result DataFrame
    result_df = pd.DataFrame({
        "StartDate": "1995-09-01",
        "EndDate": "1995-10-01",
        "PromoRevenue": [total_revenue],
        "TotalMarketRevenue": [total_market_revenue],
        "Percentage": [promo_revenue_percentage]
    })

    # Write results to CSV
    result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
else:
    print('No data found for the specified table in Redis.')
```

2. Bash script: `install_dependencies.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bash script to install all required dependencies for the Python code to run

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pandas pymongo direct_redis
```

Remember to make the bash script executable by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing. The Python code assumes that the `DirectRedis` behaves as specified in the requirements, which is different from the official Redis client; the redis dataframe retrieval code might need to be adapted to the specifics of this implementation.
