It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code that you can save as `query_code.py` to accomplish the task outlined.

```python
# query_code.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# The relevant SQL query part to fetch data from MySQL's customer table
sql = """
SELECT
    LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) AS CNTRYCODE,
    COUNT(*) as NUM_CUSTOMERS,
    SUM(C_ACCTBAL) as TOTAL_ACCTBAL
FROM
    customer
WHERE
    LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) IN ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
    AND C_ACCTBAL > (
        SELECT AVG(C_ACCTBAL)
        FROM customer
        WHERE C_ACCTBAL > 0
    )
GROUP BY
    CNTRYCODE
HAVING
    NUM_CUSTOMERS > 0
ORDER BY
    CNTRYCODE;
"""

cursor.execute(sql)
mysql_result = cursor.fetchall()

# Create a DataFrame for MySQL result
df_mysql = pd.DataFrame(mysql_result, columns=['CNTRYCODE', 'NUM_CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL_ACCTBAL'])

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch Orders DataFrame from Redis
df_orders = redis_conn.get('orders')
df_orders = pd.read_msgpack(df_orders)

# Filter orders that are older than 7 years
df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'])
seven_years_ago = pd.to_datetime("now") - pd.DateOffset(years=7)
df_orders_old = df_orders[df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] < seven_years_ago]

# Get the customer keys of the customers who have not placed order for 7 years
custkeys_no_orders_7_years = set(df_mysql['C_CUSTKEY']) - set(df_orders_old['O_CUSTKEY'])

# Filter customers who have not placed orders for 7 years
df_customers_no_orders = df_mysql[df_mysql['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(custkeys_no_orders_7_years)]

# Calculate the results
result = df_customers_no_orders.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg(
    NUM_CUSTOMERS=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'),
    TOTAL_ACCTBAL=('C_ACCTBAL', 'sum')
).reset_index()

# Sort the result
result.sort_values(by='CNTRYCODE', inplace=True)

# Write the results to a csv file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the database connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

Next, here is the Bash script called `install_dependencies.sh` to install all the dependencies.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and Pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis

# Direct Redis may need a specific install, adjust the command according to the actual package name provided by the developer
```

Remember to give execution permission to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` in the terminal before executing it.
