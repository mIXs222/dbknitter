What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken? The output should be the average yearly loss.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that retrieves data from MongoDB and Redis and calculates the required statistics:

```python
# This is mongo_redis_query.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = client['tpch']
part_collection = mongo_db['part']

# Retrieve parts with BRAND#23 and MED BAG from MongoDB
query_parts = {'P_BRAND': 'BRAND#23', 'P_CONTAINER': 'MED BAG'}
parts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part_collection.find(query_parts, {'_id': 0})))

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve lineitem table from Redis and convert to DataFrame
lineitem_raw = redis_client.get('lineitem')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(lineitem_raw, orient='records')

# Merge parts and lineitem DataFrames on P_PARTKEY and L_PARTKEY
merged_df = pd.merge(parts_df, lineitem_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')

# Filter orders with quantity less than 20% of average quantity
average_quantity = merged_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()
quantity_threshold = 0.2 * average_quantity
small_orders_df = merged_df[merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] < quantity_threshold]

# Calculate the average yearly loss
total_loss = small_orders_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()
num_years = 7
average_yearly_loss = total_loss / num_years

# Write the output to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['Average Yearly Loss'])
    csvwriter.writerow([average_yearly_loss])

print("The average yearly loss has been successfully written to query_output.csv")
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python MongoDB driver (pymongo)
pip3 install pymongo

# Install direct_redis package
pip3 install git+https://github.com/RealKinetic/direct_redis.git

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

To run the above Python script, make sure to give execution permissions to the Bash script with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` and then execute it to install the necessary packages. After that, run the Python script with `python3 mongo_redis_query.py`.
