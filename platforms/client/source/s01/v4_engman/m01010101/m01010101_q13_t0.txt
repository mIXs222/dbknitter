A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here's the Python code (query.py) to execute the distributed query using data from MySQL and MongoDB.

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_coll = mongo_db['customer']

# SQL query to count the number of orders per customer in MySQL (excluding certain order comments)
order_query = """
    SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) as order_count
    FROM orders
    WHERE O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'
    GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
"""

# Execute the MySQL query
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
mysql_cursor.execute(order_query)
orders_per_customer = dict(mysql_cursor.fetchall())

# Retrieve customers' list from MongoDB
customer_list = mongo_coll.find({}, {'C_CUSTKEY': 1})

# Final dictionary to map the number of orders to the number of customers with that order count
order_distribution = {}

# Loop over customers from MongoDB and count their orders from MySQL results
for cust in customer_list:
    custkey = cust['C_CUSTKEY']
    order_count = orders_per_customer.get(custkey, 0)
    order_distribution[order_count] = order_distribution.get(order_count, 0) + 1

# Write the output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['num_orders', 'num_customers'])
    for num_orders, num_customers in order_distribution.items():
        writer.writerow([num_orders, num_customers])

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here's the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
