The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order. Please output the columns in the order of ORDER_COUNT and O_ORDERPRIORITY\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that satisfies the requirements:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Fetch orders between given dates from MySQL
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
mysql_cursor.execute("""
SELECT O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERPRIORITY
FROM orders
WHERE O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-07-01' AND O_ORDERDATE < '1993-10-01'
""")

# Get order keys and priority in a dict with order key as the key
orders_with_priority = {}
for order in mysql_cursor:
    orders_with_priority[order[0]] = order[1]

# Query MongoDB lineitem collection
lineitem_collection = mongodb_db['lineitem']
lineitems = lineitem_collection.find({
    'L_RECEIPTDATE': {'$gt': 'L_COMMITDATE'}
})

# Filter lineitems by order keys from MySQL and count orders
order_counts = {}
for lineitem in lineitems:
    order_key = int(lineitem['L_ORDERKEY'])
    if order_key in orders_with_priority:
        order_priority = orders_with_priority[order_key]
        if order_priority in order_counts:
            order_counts[order_priority] += 1
        else:
            order_counts[order_priority] = 1

# Sort by order priority
sorted_order_counts = sorted(order_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])

# Output results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['O_ORDERPRIORITY', 'ORDER_COUNT'])
    for order_priority, count in sorted_order_counts:
        writer.writerow([order_priority, count])

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# install.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python MongoDB driver
pip install pymongo

# Install Python MySQL driver
pip install pymysql
```

Please make sure that the script has executable permissions by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```
Remember to run this bash script before attempting to execute the Python code.
