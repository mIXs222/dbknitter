The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here's the python code in `execute_query.py` to execute the query:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connecting to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
mysql_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY
FROM part
WHERE P_NAME LIKE '%Promo%'
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)
promo_parts = [row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Connecting to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = mongodb_db['lineitem']

start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 10, 1)
revenue = 0
promo_revenue = 0

for document in lineitem_collection.find({
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lt': end_date}

    extended_price = document['L_EXTENDEDPRICE']
    discount = document['L_DISCOUNT']
    order_revenue = extended_price * (1 - discount)
    if document['L_PARTKEY'] in promo_parts:
        promo_revenue += order_revenue
    revenue += order_revenue

percentage = (promo_revenue / revenue) * 100 if revenue else 0

# Writing to file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['Promotion Revenue Percentage'])
    writer.writerow([percentage])

print("Query executed. Results are written to query_output.csv")
```

For the bash script `install_dependencies.sh` to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not already installed:
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Remember to give the bash script the necessary permissions to execute by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
