Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, 1. Here is the requested Python code (query_execute.py):

```python

# Retrieve qualifying orders from MySQL
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Close connections

```

2. Here is the requested bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python3 and pip (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
