It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that connects to both MySQL and MongoDB, retrieves the data, and processes it according to the user's query:

```python
# file: execute_query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Define connection parameters for MySQL
mysql_conn_params = {
    "host": "mysql",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "db": "tpch"
}

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_params)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Define the query to execute in MySQL
mysql_query = """
    SELECT
        P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, PS_PARTKEY
    FROM
        part, partsupp
    WHERE
        part.P_PARTKEY = partsupp.PS_PARTKEY
        AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'
        AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
        AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
"""
# Execute the MySQL query
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)
parts_suppliers = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
mysql_conn.close()

# Extract part keys that satisfy the conditions
part_keys = {row[3] for row in parts_suppliers}

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
supplier_collection = mongo_db['supplier']

# Use aggregation to filter out suppliers with complaints
pipeline = [

    {"$project": {"S_SUPPKEY": 1}}
]

print("The query output has been written to query_output.csv")
```

And here is a Bash script to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# file: install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update repository and install pip if not present
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
