This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get customers who haven't ordered for 7 years
seven_years_ago = (datetime.today() - timedelta(days=7*365)).date()
with mysql_conn.cursor() as mysql_cursor:
    mysql_cursor.execute("""
    SELECT O_CUSTKEY
    FROM orders
    WHERE O_ORDERDATE >= %s
    """, (seven_years_ago,))
    recent_customers = {row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()}

# Calculate average account balance for customers with C_ACCTBAL > 0
avg_acct_balance = mongodb.customer.aggregate([
    {'$match': {'C_ACCTBAL': {'$gt': 0}}},
    {'$group': {'_id': None, 'avg_balance': {'$avg': '$C_ACCTBAL'}}}
]).next()['avg_balance']

# Get customers by country code with account balance greater than average
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
results = []
for code in country_codes:
    customers = list(mongodb.customer.find(
        {
            'C_PHONE': {'$regex': f'^{code}'},
            'C_CUSTKEY': {'$nin': list(recent_customers)},
            'C_ACCTBAL': {'$gt': avg_acct_balance}
        },
        {'_id': 0, 'C_ACCTBAL': 1}
    ))
    num_customers = len(customers)
    total_acct_balance = sum(customer['C_ACCTBAL'] for customer in customers)
    results.append((code, num_customers, total_acct_balance))

# Sort results by country code
results.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

# Output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['CNTRYCODE', 'NUM_CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL_ACCT_BALANCE'])
    for result in results:
        csvwriter.writerow(result)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

Now, here is the bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python library dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
