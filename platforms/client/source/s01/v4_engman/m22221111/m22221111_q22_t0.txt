message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase. This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the python code to execute the required query on your MongoDB database:

```python
# sales_opportunity_query.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connect to the MongoDB server
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']

# Define the list of valid country codes
valid_cntrycodes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']

# Get today's date to calculate orders from 7 years ago
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365*7)

# Find the average account balance of people with account balance > 0.00 in those countries
avg_balance_pipeline = [
    {
        '$match': {
            'C_PHONE': {'$regex': '^(' + '|'.join(valid_cntrycodes) + ')'},
            'C_ACCTBAL': {'$gt': 0}
        }
    },
    {
        '$group': {
            '_id': {'CNTRYCODE': {'$substr': ['$C_PHONE', 0, 2]}},
            'AVG_BALANCE': {'$avg': '$C_ACCTBAL'}
        }
    }
]

avg_balances = {doc['_id']['CNTRYCODE']: doc['AVG_BALANCE'] for doc in db.customer.aggregate(avg_balance_pipeline)}

# Retrieve customers that have not placed orders for 7 years
customers_no_orders = db.customer.find(
    {
        'C_PHONE': {'$regex': '^(' + '|'.join(valid_cntrycodes) + ')'},
        'C_ACCTBAL': {'$gt': 0}
    }
)

# Prepare the data structure for the results
results = {}

for customer in customers_no_orders:
    cntrycode = customer['C_PHONE'][:2]
    
    # Check if the customer has orders within the past 7 years
    recent_order = db.orders.find_one(
        {
            'O_CUSTKEY': customer['C_CUSTKEY'],
            'O_ORDERDATE': {'$gte': seven_years_ago}
        }
    )

    # Check if customer's balance is greater than the average in his/her country
    if not recent_order and customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > avg_balances[cntrycode]:
        if cntrycode not in results:
            results[cntrycode] = {'NUM_CUSTOMERS': 0, 'TOTAL_BALANCE': 0}
        
        results[cntrycode]['NUM_CUSTOMERS'] += 1
        results[cntrycode]['TOTAL_BALANCE'] += customer['C_ACCTBAL']

# Write the results to file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['CNTRYCODE', 'NUM_CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL_BALANCE'])
    
    for cntrycode, data in sorted(results.items()):
        writer.writerow([cntrycode, data['NUM_CUSTOMERS'], data['TOTAL_BALANCE']])
```

Next is the bash script to install all dependencies required to run the Python code above:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pymongo
```

To execute the bash script, you may need to give it execution permission using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`, and then run it with `./install_dependencies.sh`. Make sure you run it with root privileges or with `sudo` if needed.
