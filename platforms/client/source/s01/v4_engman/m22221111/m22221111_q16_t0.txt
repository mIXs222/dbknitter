It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that fetches data from MongoDB and Redis, processes the data according to the requirements, and saves the output to a CSV file.

Python Code (run_query.py):
```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from bson.json_util import dumps
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = client.tpch
partsupp_collection = mongodb.partsupp

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get partsupp data from MongoDB
partsupp_docs = partsupp_collection.find({})
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(partsupp_docs))

# Get part and supplier data from Redis
part_redis_data = redis.get('part')
supplier_redis_data = redis.get('supplier')

# Loading Redis data into DataFrames
part_df = pd.read_json(part_redis_data)
supplier_df = pd.read_json(supplier_redis_data)

# Filtering data based on given attributes
filtered_parts = part_df[
    (part_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9])) &
    (part_df['P_TYPE'].str.upper() != 'MEDIUM POLISHED') &
    (part_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45')
]

filtered_suppliers = supplier_df[
    ~(supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer.*Complaints', regex=True, case=False))
]

# Merging the data to get suppliers who can supply the required parts
result_df = pd.merge(
    left=filtered_parts,
    right=partsupp_df,
    how='inner',
    left_on='P_PARTKEY',
    right_on='PS_PARTKEY'
)

result_df = pd.merge(
    left=result_df,
    right=filtered_suppliers,
    how='inner',
    left_on='PS_SUPPKEY',
    right_on='S_SUPPKEY'
)

# Aggregating data to get counts
final_result = result_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])['S_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index()
final_result.columns = ['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'SUPPLIER_COUNT']
final_result.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_COUNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True], inplace=True)

# Saving the result to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the bash script to install all the dependencies needed to run the above Python code.

Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install pip if not installed
if ! command -v pip &>/dev/null; then
    echo "pip could not be found, installing..."
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    python get-pip.py
    rm get-pip.py
fi

# Install the required Python libraries
pip install pymongo pandas redis direct-redis
```

Make sure to give execution permissions to the bash script by running:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Execute it with:
```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```
And then execute the Python script with:
```bash
python run_query.py
```
