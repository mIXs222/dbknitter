A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Establish connection to MySQL server
conn = pymysql.connect(host=db_info['host'],
                       user=db_info['user'],
                       password=db_info['password'],
                       database=db_info['database'])

try:
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Writing results to query_output.csv
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            # Write header
            csv_writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])
            # Write data
            csv_writer.writerows(results)

finally:
    conn.close()
```

Next, here's the Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if not installed
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql
```

Give execution permission to the script and run it using the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Then execute the Python script with:

```bash
python3 pricing_summary_report.py
