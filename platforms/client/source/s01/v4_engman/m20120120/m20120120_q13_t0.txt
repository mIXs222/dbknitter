This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the described query across the different databases and save the results to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# Python code to execute the query (query_code.py)
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import re

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_customers = mongo_db['customer']
mongo_customers_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_customers.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
redis_orders = redis_client.get('orders')
redis_orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_orders)

# Filter out orders with 'pending' and 'deposits' in O_COMMENT
filtered_orders = redis_orders_df[~redis_orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', flags=re.IGNORECASE, regex=True)]

# Join the dataframes on the customer key
merged_df = pd.merge(mongo_customers_df, filtered_orders, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='inner')

# Group by customer key and count the number of orders each customer has made
grouped = merged_df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY').size().reset_index(name='orders_count')

# Get the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made
customer_order_distribution = grouped.groupby('orders_count').size().reset_index(name='customer_count')

# Write the result to the 'query_output.csv' file
customer_order_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the provided Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install dependencies (install_dependencies.sh)

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python MongoDB client library, pymonogo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas for DataFrame support in Python
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis library to interact with Redis
pip3 install git+https://github.com/coleifer/direct_redis
```

Please make sure you have execution rights and run the bash script before running the Python code.
