The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query_execute.py`) to execute the described query:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Query for MySQL (partsupp)
mysql_query = """
    SELECT
        PS_SUPPKEY
    FROM
        partsupp
    WHERE
        PS_PARTKEY != 45
"""
mysql_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Query for MongoDB (part)
mongo_query = {
    '$and': [
        {'P_SIZE': {'$in': [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]}},
        {'P_TYPE': {'$ne': 'MEDIUM POLISHED'}},
        {'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'}}
    ]
}
mongo_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.part.find(mongo_query, {'_id': 0, 'P_PARTKEY': 1})))

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query for Redis (supplier)
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('supplier'))

# Filtering suppliers without complaints
filtered_supplier_df = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Combine the results
combined_df = pd.merge(
    mysql_df, 
    mongo_df, 
    left_on='PS_PARTKEY', 
    right_on='P_PARTKEY', 
)

final_result = combined_df[combined_df['PS_SUPPKEY'].isin(filtered_supplier_df['S_SUPPKEY'])]
final_result = final_result.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).size().reset_index(name='SUPPLIER_COUNT')
final_result = final_result.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_COUNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write result to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all the required dependencies for the Python code to run:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install pip if it's not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Remember to make the Bash script executable with the `chmod` command:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
