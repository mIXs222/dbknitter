This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

Python Code (query.py):
```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Function to fetch MySQL data
def fetch_mysql_data():
    connection = pymysql.connect(
        host='mysql',
        user='root',
        password='my-secret-pw',
        database='tpch',
    )

    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            sql = "SELECT C_CUSTKEY FROM customer"
            cursor.execute(sql)
            result = cursor.fetchall()
            mysql_data = {row[0] for row in result}
    finally:
        connection.close()

    return mysql_data

# Function to fetch MongoDB data
def fetch_mongodb_data(customer_keys):
    client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
    db = client['tpch']
    orders = db['orders']
    pipeline = [
        {"$match": {
            "O_CUSTKEY": {"$in": list(customer_keys)},
            "O_ORDERSTATUS": {"$ne": 'P'},  # Excluding pending orders
            "O_COMMENT": {"$not": pymongo.regex.Regex(".*pending.*deposits.*")}
        }},
        {"$group": {

            "count": {"$sum": 1}
        }}
    ]
    result = list(orders.aggregate(pipeline))
    client.close()

    return result

# Process data and write to CSV
def process_data():
    mysql_data = fetch_mysql_data()
    mongodb_data = fetch_mongodb_data(mysql_data)

    customer_order_count = {}
    for order in mongodb_data:
        count = order['count']
        if count in customer_order_count:
            customer_order_count[count] += 1
        else:
            customer_order_count[count] = 1

    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['Number of Orders', 'Number of Customers'])
        for num_orders, num_customers in sorted(customer_order_count.items()):
            writer.writerow([num_orders, num_customers])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_data()
```

And here is the bash script for installing all dependencies to run the Python code:

Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
