If several suppliers in that EUROPE offers the BRASS part and size of 15 at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the suppliers with the order by account balance in descending order, and nation name, supplier name, part key in ascending order. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information. Please output the columns in the order of N_NAME, P_MFGR, P_PARTKEY, S_ACCTBAL, S_ADDRESS, S_COMMENT, S_NAME, S_PHONE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, First, the Python code to execute the query (save this as `query_code.py`):

```python

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',

mysql_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read data from Redis

# Write the result to a CSV file
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next, the Bash script to install all dependencies (save this as `setup_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip for Python package management
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python MySQL client
pip3 install pymysql

# Install Pandas library
pip3 install pandas

# Install redis-py library
pip3 install redis direct-redis
```

Make sure to set the executable permission for the bash script using `chmod +x setup_dependencies.sh` before running it.
