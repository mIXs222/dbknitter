The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

2. Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash

# Update packages and install python3 and pip3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install all necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct_redis

# Note: direct_redis might not be a real package as of the knowledge cutoff date (2023-03-07);
# if it's not available on PyPI, you would have to install it from its source or adjust the Python code accordingly.
```
Please replace the direct_redis package with the appropriate code or package to interact with Redis if it doesn't really exist as of the writing of this code, it is used as a placeholder for the instructions provided.
