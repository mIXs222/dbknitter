This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

```

### 2. Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python pip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql

# Install PyMongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install required libraries for CSV and datetime, they should be available in Python's standard library.
```

Remember to give execution rights to the bash script before running it by using the command `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`.
