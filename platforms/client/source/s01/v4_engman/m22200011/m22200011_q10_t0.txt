The query lists the customer's key, name, revenue lost, account balance, nation, address, phone number and comment information.

response, Firstly, here is the python code that will execute the required query over the distributed databases:

```python
# file: query_code.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

# Select customers from MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ACCTBAL, C_ADDRESS, C_PHONE, C_COMMENT
FROM customer;
"""

customers_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Select orders and lineitem from MongoDB
orders_coll = mongo_db['orders']
lineitem_coll = mongo_db['lineitem']

orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_coll.find(
    {"O_ORDERDATE": {"$gte": "1993-10-01", "$lt": "1994-01-01"}}
)))

lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_coll.find()))

# Merging orders with lineitem
merged_df = pd.merge(orders_df, lineitem_df, how='inner', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Calculate revenue lost
merged_df['REVENUE_LOST'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Sum revenue lost grouped by O_CUSTKEY
revenue_lost_df = merged_df.groupby('O_CUSTKEY').agg({'REVENUE_LOST': 'sum'}).reset_index()

# Connect to Redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Load nation DataFrame from Redis
nation_df = pd.read_json(r.get('nation').decode('utf-8'))

# Merge customers with revenue lost and nation
final_df = pd.merge(customers_df, revenue_lost_df, how='inner', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
final_df = pd.merge(final_df, nation_df, how='left', left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Selecting required columns
final_df = final_df[['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'REVENUE_LOST', 'C_ACCTBAL', 'N_NAME', 'C_ADDRESS', 'C_PHONE', 'C_COMMENT']]

# Sort by revenue lost in ascending, customer key and name in ascending, and account balance in descending
final_df.sort_values(by=['REVENUE_LOST', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ACCTBAL'], 
                     ascending=[True, True, True, False], inplace=True)

# Output to CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Secondly, here is the bash script that includes the installation commands for all dependencies required to run the python code provided above:

```bash
# file: install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MySQL dependencies
apt-get install -y default-libmysqlclient-dev 

# Install redis-tools for direct_redis
apt-get install -y redis-tools

# Install Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Make sure to grant executable permissions to the bash script with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it. Then you can run the bash script with `./install_dependencies.sh` to install the dependencies. After installing the dependencies, you can run the python script with `python3 query_code.py`.
