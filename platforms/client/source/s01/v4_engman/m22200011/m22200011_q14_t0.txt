The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, 1. Here's the Python code required to execute the query:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MongoDB connection and data retrieval
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_collection = mongo_db['lineitem']

# Filter by date range in MongoDB query
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 10, 1)
lineitems = list(mongo_collection.find({
    "L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte": start_date, "$lt": end_date}
}, {'_id': False}))

# Convert to DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(lineitems)

# Calculating revenue
lineitem_df['revenue'] = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Redis connection and data retrieval
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
part_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('part'), orient='records')

# Assuming part promotion details are flagged in P_COMMENT with the string 'Promo'
is_promo_part = part_df['P_COMMENT'].str.contains('Promo')
promo_parts = part_df[is_promo_part]

# Combine the results
promo_parts_set = set(promo_parts['P_PARTKEY'])
lineitem_df['is_promo'] = lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(promo_parts_set)
promo_revenue = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['is_promo']]['revenue'].sum()
total_revenue = lineitem_df['revenue'].sum()

# Calculate and save the promotion effect
promo_effect = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) if total_revenue else 0
promo_effect_percentage = promo_effect * 100

# Saving to CSV
output = pd.DataFrame([{'Promotion Effect (%)': promo_effect_percentage}])
output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Here's the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# setup.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Install Python and pip if not already installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas

# Installing the direct_redis package (not available by default in pip)
# You may need to add the package to your PYTHONPATH manually or install from source
git clone https://github.com/mymarilyn/direct_redis
cd direct_redis
python3 setup.py install
cd ..
rm -rf direct_redis

# Note: If this is being provided as a script rather than a doc/explanation,
# it's essential to add execute permissions to the script using chmod +x setup.sh
