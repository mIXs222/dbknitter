The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code to execute the given query on MongoDB using pymongo and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# query.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Establish a connection to the MongoDB server
client = MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)

# Select the database
db = client["tpch"]

# Define the pipeline for aggregation
pipeline = [

# Run the aggregation query
results = db.lineitem.aggregate(pipeline)

# Field names for the CSV output
fieldnames = [
    "L_RETURNFLAG",
    "L_LINESTATUS",
    "SUM_QTY",
    "SUM_BASE_PRICE",
    "SUM_DISC_PRICE",
    "SUM_CHARGE",

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:

            "COUNT_ORDER": result["count_order"]
        })

# Close the MongoDB connection
client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and PIP if they are not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymongo
```
Make sure to give the bash script execution permissions before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

And to execute the bash script:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Python code with:

```bash
python3 query.py
```
