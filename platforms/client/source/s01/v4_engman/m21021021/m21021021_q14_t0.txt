The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use to execute the cross-database query:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connection information for MySQL
mysql_conn_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# Connection information for MongoDB
mongo_conn_info = {
    'host': 'mongodb',
    'port': 27017,
    'db': 'tpch',
}

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_conn_info)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_conn = pymongo.MongoClient(host=mongo_conn_info['host'], port=mongo_conn_info['port'])
mongo_db = mongo_conn[mongo_conn_info['db']]

# Fetch promotional parts from MySQL
promo_parts_sql = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY
FROM part
WHERE P_NAME LIKE 'PROMO%'
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(promo_parts_sql)
promo_parts = [row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]

# Fetch lineitem data from MongoDB within the specified date range
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 10, 1)
lineitems = mongo_db.lineitem.find({
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lt': end_date},
    'L_PARTKEY': {'$in': promo_parts}
})

# Calculate revenue for promotional parts
total_revenue = 0.0
for lineitem in lineitems:
    revenue = lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem['L_DISCOUNT'])
    total_revenue += revenue

# Write query result to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['Total_Revenue'])
    csvwriter.writerow([total_revenue])

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_conn.close()
```

Next, here is the Bash script for installing all the necessary dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the pymysql and pymongo Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Remember to grant execute permissions to the Bash script before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

You can then run the Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

And then execute the Python script to perform the query:

```bash
python3 promotion_effect_query.py
```
