It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that fetches the data from MySQL and Redis, and performs the necessary processing:

```python
# query_code.py

import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch',
)

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query customers from MySQL
customer_query = """
SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL
FROM customer
WHERE SUBSTR(C_PHONE, 1, 2) IN ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
AND C_ACCTBAL > 0.00;
"""
mysql_cursor = mysql_connection.cursor()
mysql_cursor.execute(customer_query)
customer_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(customer_data, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_PHONE', 'C_ACCTBAL'])

# Get orders from Redis
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_connection.get('orders'))

# Pre-process the orders data
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)
orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] < seven_years_ago]

# Use a left join to merge customer and orders data and filter non-ordered customers
merged_df = pd.merge(customer_df, orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left')
non_ordered_df = merged_df[pd.isnull(merged_df['O_ORDERKEY'])]

# Calculate average account balance for customers with account balance greater than 0
avg_acct_bal = customer_df[customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0]['C_ACCTBAL'].mean()

# Filter customers with balance greater than the average
