response, Here is the Python code (`query_code.py`) that gathers the data from the different databases, processes the required query logic, and writes the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cur = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve customer data from MySQL
mysql_cur.execute("SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_MKTSEGMENT FROM customer WHERE C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING';")
customers = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cur.fetchall(), columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'C_MKTSEGMENT'])

# Retrieve lineitem data from MongoDB
lineitems = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.lineitem.find()))

# Retrieve orders data from Redis
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('orders'))

# Close MySQL cursor and connection
mysql_cur.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Processing the data
# Merge customers and orders on C_CUSTKEY
merged_df_customer_orders = pd.merge(customers, orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')

# Orders that had been ordered before 1995-03-05 but be shipped after 1995-03-15
filtered_orders = merged_df_customer_orders[
    (merged_df_customer_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] < '1995-03-05') &
    (merged_df_customer_orders['O_SHIPDATE'] > '1995-03-15')
]

# Merge filtered_orders with lineitems on O_ORDERKEY
final_df = pd.merge(filtered_orders, lineitems, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Calculate REVENUE
final_df['REVENUE'] = final_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - final_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group by O_ORDERKEY and sum REVENUE, then sort by REVENUE in descending order
result = final_df.groupby(['O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()
result = result.sort_values(by='REVENUE', ascending=False)

# Write the result to query_output.csv
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, columns=['O_ORDERKEY', 'REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])
```

And here is the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python's package manager pip if not already installed
which pip || curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

# Install pymysql for MySQL connections
pip install pymysql

# Install pymongo for connecting to MongoDB
pip install pymongo

# Install pandas for DataFrame operations
pip install pandas

# Install direct_redis for Redis connections
pip install direct_redis
```

Run this bash script in your terminal, and then execute the Python script to perform the query across the different databases as per the requirements. Make sure that you have access to the necessary services at the provided hostnames and have permissions to install the required packages.
