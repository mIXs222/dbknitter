This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`execute_query.py`) to accomplish the task:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Query MySQL for customer data
customer_query = """
SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME FROM customer
"""
customers_df = pd.read_sql(customer_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis database
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders_df = redis_conn.get('orders')
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_df)

# Filter orders based on the comment criteria
orders_df = orders_df[~orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', regex=True)]

# Count the number of orders for each customer
orders_count_df = orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'].value_counts().reset_index()
orders_count_df.columns = ['C_CUSTKEY', 'OrderCount']

# Merge customers data with orders count
merged_df = pd.merge(customers_df, orders_count_df, on='C_CUSTKEY', how='left')
merged_df['OrderCount'] = merged_df['OrderCount'].fillna(0)

# Calculate the distribution of customers by the number of orders
customers_distribution_df = merged_df['OrderCount'].value_counts().reset_index()
customers_distribution_df.columns = ['NumberOfOrders', 'NumberOfCustomers']

# Write the output to a CSV file
customers_distribution_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And, here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install the required dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update packages and install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct_redis
