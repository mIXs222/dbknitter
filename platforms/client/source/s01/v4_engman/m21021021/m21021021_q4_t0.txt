Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (query_execute.py):

```python
import pymongo
from bson import json_util
import pandas as pd
import json
from datetime import datetime
import direct_redis

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = mongo_client["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongodb["lineitem"]

# Generate the query for MongoDB
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {
        "L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte": datetime(1993, 7, 1), "$lt": datetime(1993, 10, 1)},
        "L_COMMITDATE": {"$lt": "L_RECEIPTDATE"}
    }},
    {"$project": {"L_ORDERKEY": 1}}
]
mongo_lineitems = list(lineitem_collection.aggregate(pipeline))

# Extract order keys
order_keys = [lineitem["L_ORDERKEY"] for lineitem in mongo_lineitems]

# Redis connection and query
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
orders_json_list = r.get('orders')
orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_json_list, orient='split')

# Filter orders that are in the MongoDB result
filtered_orders_df = orders_df[orders_df['O_ORDERKEY'].isin(order_keys)]

# Group by O_ORDERPRIORITY and count
order_priority_count = filtered_orders_df.groupby(["O_ORDERPRIORITY"])["O_ORDERKEY"].count().reset_index(name='ORDER_COUNT')

# Sort by O_ORDERPRIORITY
sorted_order_priority_count = order_priority_count.sort_values(by="O_ORDERPRIORITY")

# Save query result to file
sorted_order_priority_count.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install custom direct_redis library (assuming it can be pip-installed, otherwise you need to provide the correct way to install it)
pip3 install direct_redis
