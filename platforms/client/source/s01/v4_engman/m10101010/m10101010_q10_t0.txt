The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's key, name, revenue lost, account balance, nation, address, phone number and comment information. The results are listed in ascending order of revenue lost, customer key, and customer name and descending order of customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

And this is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
# install.sh file

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Python3 and PIP if they are not installed
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL and PyMongo Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Make sure to run the Bash script with sufficient privileges to install the packages and execute the Python code in an environment where the dependencies are not yet installed.
