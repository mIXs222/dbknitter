The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code required to execute the query on the original data:

```python
# Python code to execute the query (query.py)

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql', 
    user='root', 
    password='my-secret-pw', 
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']

# Query to get the necessary data from MySQL
# Only fetch suppliers that do not have complaints (S_COMMENT not containing 'Customer' and 'Complaints')
mysql_query = """
SELECT S_SUPPKEY 
FROM supplier 
WHERE S_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%%Customer%%Complaints%%';
"""

# Execute MySQL Query
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    suppliers = cursor.fetchall()

# Filtering the list of suppliers
supplier_ids = [str(s[0]) for s in suppliers]

# Query in MongoDB to get data from the 'part' and 'partsupp' collections
# We also filter the parts based on the given attributes and sizes.
acceptable_sizes = [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]

# Query parts that satisfy the conditions
mongodb_query_parts = {
    'P_SIZE': {'$in': acceptable_sizes},
    'P_TYPE': {'$ne': 'MEDIUM POLISHED'},
    'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'}
}

parts_cursor = mongodb_db['part'].find(mongodb_query_parts, {'P_PARTKEY': 1})
part_keys = [p['P_PARTKEY'] for p in parts_cursor]

# Query partsupp collection to find the parts supplied by the filtered suppliers
mongodb_query_partsupp = {
    'PS_PARTKEY': {'$in': part_keys},
    'PS_SUPPKEY': {'$in': supplier_ids}
}

# Count and group by brand, type, and size
pipeline = [
    {'$match': mongodb_query_partsupp},
    {'$lookup': {
        'from': 'part',
        'localField': 'PS_PARTKEY',
        'foreignField': 'P_PARTKEY',
        'as': 'part'
    }},
    {'$unwind': '$part'},
    {'$group': {
        '_id': {
            'brand': '$part.P_BRAND',
            'type': '$part.P_TYPE',
            'size': '$part.P_SIZE'
        },
        'count': {'$sum': 1}
    }},
    {'$sort': {'count': -1, '_id.brand': 1, '_id.type': 1, '_id.size': 1}}
]

result = list(mongodb_db['partsupp'].aggregate(pipeline))

# Write the output to 'query_output.csv'
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['brand', 'type', 'size', 'supplier_count'])

    for doc in result:
        writer.writerow([doc['_id']['brand'], doc['_id']['type'], doc['_id']['size'], doc['count']])

# Close the database connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongodb_client.close()
```

Please note that this is a straightforward implementation that does not account for potential data inconsistency nor edge cases.

And here's the Bash script to install all the dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install dependencies (install_deps.sh)

# Update repositories and install Python and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymongo pymysql
```

You will need to ensure that the script has execution permissions (`chmod +x install_deps.sh`) and then execute it before running the Python script.
