The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here's the Python code to perform the task described:

```python
# query.py

import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Define MongoDB connection and query
def get_promotional_parts():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
    db = client['tpch']
    promotional_parts = db.part.find({}, {'P_PARTKEY': 1})
    promotional_part_keys = [pp['P_PARTKEY'] for pp in promotional_parts]
    return promotional_part_keys

# Define MySQL connection and query
def get_revenue_for_promotional_parts(promotional_part_keys):
    connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                                 user='root',
                                 password='my-secret-pw',
                                 database='tpch')
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            sql = """
            SELECT
                SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue
            FROM
                lineitem
            WHERE
                L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01' AND
                L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01' AND
                L_PARTKEY IN (%s)
            """
            in_p = ', '.join(list(map(lambda x: '%s', promotional_part_keys)))
            sql = sql % in_p
            cursor.execute(sql, promotional_part_keys)
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return result if result else (0,)
    finally:
        connection.close()

# Main program flow
def main():
    promotional_part_keys = get_promotional_parts()
    total_revenue = get_revenue_for_promotional_parts(promotional_part_keys)

    # Calculate revenue as a percentage
    total_revenue_amount = total_revenue[0] if total_revenue[0] else 0
    revenue_percentage = (total_revenue_amount / total_revenue_amount) * 100 if total_revenue_amount else 0

    # Write results to a CSV file
    with open('query_output.csv', mode='w') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['revenue_percentage'])
        writer.writerow([revenue_percentage])

# Execute the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that the Python code assumes that the definition of "promotional parts" can be derived from the MongoDB 'part' collection directly, with no particular criteria specified in your request.

Now for the Bash script with all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
# install.sh

#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Update repositories and install Python and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Ensure you give execution permission to the bash script by running `chmod +x install.sh` before executing it.
