This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
