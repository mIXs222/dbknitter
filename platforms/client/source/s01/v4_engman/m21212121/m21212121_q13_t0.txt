This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# Python code to execute the described query (query.py)

from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

def connect_to_mongodb(host, port, db_name):
    client = MongoClient(host, port)
    db = client[db_name]
    return db

def connect_to_redis(host, port, db_name):
    return direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=host, port=port, db=db_name)

def get_customers_from_mongodb(db):
    return pd.DataFrame(list(db.customer.find({}, {
        '_id': 0,
        'C_CUSTKEY': 1
    })))

def get_orders_from_redis(redis_connection):
    orders_df = redis_connection.get('orders')
    orders_df = pd.read_json(orders_df, orient='records')
    return orders_df[(~orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending')) &
                     (~orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('deposits'))]

def main():
    # Connect to MongoDB
    mongodb = connect_to_mongodb('mongodb', 27017, 'tpch')
    mongodb_customers = get_customers_from_mongodb(mongodb)

    # Connect to Redis
    redis_conn = connect_to_redis('redis', 6379, '0')
    redis_orders = get_orders_from_redis(redis_conn)

    # Merge data and query logic
    orders_count = redis_orders['O_CUSTKEY'].value_counts().reset_index()
    orders_count.columns = ['C_CUSTKEY', 'number_of_orders']

    # Aggregate to find number of customers per number of orders
    distribution = orders_count['number_of_orders'].value_counts().reset_index()
    distribution.columns = ['number_of_orders', 'number_of_customers']

    # Write output to CSV
    distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install all dependencies (install_dependencies.sh)

# Update repositories and packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python and Pip
sudo apt-get install python3 -y
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install the necessary Python libraries
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install direct-redis
pip3 install pandas
```

Make sure to give executable permissions to the bash script with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
