What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken? The output should be the average yearly loss.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested:

```python
# query.py
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# MongoDB connection and data retrieval
client = MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongodb_db = client["tpch"]
lineitem_collection = mongodb_db["lineitem"]

# Aggregate to compute average quantity for the BRAND#23 and MED BAG
pipeline = [
    {
        "$match": {
            "L_LINESTATUS": {"$in": ["F", "O"]},  # considering all orders (past and pending)
        }
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": None,
            "average_quantity": {"$avg": "$L_QUANTITY"}
        }
    }
]
average_quantity_result = list(lineitem_collection.aggregate(pipeline))
average_quantity = average_quantity_result[0]["average_quantity"] if average_quantity_result else 0

# Redis connection and data retrieval
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)
part_records = redis_connection.get('part')
part_df = pd.read_json(part_records)

# Filter parts with BRAND#23 and MED BAG
filtered_parts = part_df[(part_df["P_BRAND"] == "BRAND#23") & (part_df["P_CONTAINER"] == "MED BAG")]

# Join MongoDB and Redis dataframes
lineitems_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Filter lineitems with parts of interest
lineitems_filtered = lineitems_df[lineitems_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(filtered_parts['P_PARTKEY'])]

# Calculate loss in revenue
threshold_quantity = average_quantity * 0.20
loss_lineitems = lineitems_filtered[lineitems_filtered['L_QUANTITY'] < threshold_quantity]
loss_lineitems['gross_loss'] = loss_lineitems['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] - (loss_lineitems['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * loss_lineitems['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate average yearly loss by considering the lifespan of the dataset (7 years)
average_yearly_loss = loss_lineitems['gross_loss'].sum() / 7

# Write the average yearly loss to the file query_output.csv
output_df = pd.DataFrame([{'average_yearly_loss': average_yearly_loss}])
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script for installing the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 if not already installed (optional)
# sudo apt-get install -y python3

# Install pip for Python 3 if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct_redis
