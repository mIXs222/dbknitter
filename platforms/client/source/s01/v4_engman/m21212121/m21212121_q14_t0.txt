The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
mongo_lineitem = mongo_db['lineitem']

# Redis connection
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Mongo query to select the documents from lineitem within the dates
lineitems = mongo_lineitem.find({
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': '1995-09-01', '$lt': '1995-10-01'}
})

# Create DataFrame from mongo documents
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitems))

# Redis query to get part table
part_raw = redis_client.get('part')
part_df = pd.read_json(part_raw)

# Join lineitem and part tables on L_PARTKEY == P_PARTKEY
merged_df = lineitem_df.merge(part_df, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate revenue and check promotional status for parts
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
promotional_revenue = merged_df['REVENUE'].sum()

# Calculate the total revenue so we can calculate the percentage
total_revenue = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum() * (1 - lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT']).sum()

# Calculate final promotional percentage
promotional_percentage = (promotional_revenue / total_revenue) * 100

# Save results to a CSV
result_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Promotional Revenue Percentage': [promotional_percentage]
})
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo direct_redis pandas
