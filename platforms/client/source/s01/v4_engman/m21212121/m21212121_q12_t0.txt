We only consider line items that are actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the l_receiptdate should exceeds the l_commitdate, the ship mode should be in 'mail' or 'ship'. Also, only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The output results are grouped and ordered by l_shipmode in ascending order. For each group, we also count the number of lineitems of high order priority (those with priority URGENT or HIGH), and the number of lineitems of low order priority  (with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query on your original data:

```python
# import necessary packages
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import datetime

# connect to mongodb
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client.tpch
lineitem_collection = db.lineitem

# query lineitem data in mongodb
lineitem_query = {
    "L_RECEIPTDATE": {"$gte": datetime.datetime(1994, 1, 1), "$lt": datetime.datetime(1995, 1, 1)},
    "L_SHIPMODE": {"$in": ["MAIL", "SHIP"]},
    "L_COMMITDATE": {"$lt": "$L_COMMITDATE"}
}
lineitem_cursor = lineitem_collection.find(lineitem_query, projection={'_id': False})
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_cursor))

# Connect to redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get orders dataframe from redis
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'))

# Merging the data from both sources based on L_ORDERKEY and O_ORDERKEY
merged_df = pd.merge(left=lineitem_df, right=orders_df, how='inner', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Check if L_RECEIPTDATE exceeds L_COMMITDATE, and shipping before L_COMMITDATE
merged_df['is_late'] = merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']
merged_df = merged_df[merged_df['is_late'] & (merged_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'])]

# Add column for priority grouping
merged_df['priority_group'] = merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].apply(lambda x: 'HIGH' if x in ['URGENT', 'HIGH'] else 'LOW')

# Grouping by L_SHIPMODE and priority_group, and counting
grouped_df = merged_df.groupby(['L_SHIPMODE', 'priority_group']).size().reset_index(name='count')

# Pivoting the dataframe to get required format
pivot_df = grouped_df.pivot(index='L_SHIPMODE', columns='priority_group', values='count').fillna(0)

# Save result to csv
pivot_df.to_csv('query_output.csv')

print("Query output saved to query_output.csv")
```

And here is the corresponding bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update 

# Install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis
```

Please save each block of code as their respective `.py` and `.sh` files. The Python code should be saved as `execute_query.py`, and the bash script should be saved as `install_dependencies.sh`. Make sure to make the bash script executable by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
