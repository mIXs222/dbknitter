Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Write the results to a CSV file

```

2. Bash Script (`install_dependencies.sh`):
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct_redis

# Note: The direct_redis package is hypothetical as there is
# no such package known at the time of writing. The package is
# treated as a given instruction for demonstration purposes.
```

Please save each snippet in its respective file with the given names (query.py for the Python code and install_dependencies.sh for the Bash script). Make sure to give execution permissions to the Bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` after creating it.
