Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped before 1998-09-02. The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```sh
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Ensure pip is installed
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql library
pip3 install pymysql
``` 

Make sure to provide execution permissions for the bash script before running it by using the following command:

```sh
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
