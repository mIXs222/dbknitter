Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Potential Part Promotion query identifies suppliers who have an excess of a forest part; an excess is defined to be more than 50% of the parts like the forest part that the supplier shipped between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 for CANADA. Only parts whose names share a certain naming convention are considered.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query:

**query.py**
```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Define query to execute
query = """

           sum(ps.PS_AVAILQTY) as total_parts

    INNER JOIN part p ON ps.PS_PARTKEY = p.P_PARTKEY
    INNER JOIN nation n ON s.S_NATIONKEY = n.N_NATIONKEY
    INNER JOIN lineitem l ON ps.PS_PARTKEY = l.L_PARTKEY AND ps.PS_SUPPKEY = l.L_SUPPKEY
    WHERE n.N_NAME = 'CANADA'

# Establish a database connection
