The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Below is the Bash script to install all the dependencies needed to run the Python script. This assumes that Python and pip are already installed on the system.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# file: install_dependencies.sh

# Ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to date
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install pymysql, which is a required package to connect to the MySQL database
pip install pymysql
```

You should make both `run_query.py` and `install_dependencies.sh` executable by running `chmod +x run_query.py install_dependencies.sh` on a Unix-like terminal. Then, you can execute the bash script to install dependencies and run the Python script to execute the query and generate the CSV file.
