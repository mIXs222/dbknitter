Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase. This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`query_code.py`) which does not contain any explanation, as requested:

```python
import pymysql
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Calculate the date 7 years ago from today
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)

# Open connection to the MySQL database
conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch', charset='utf8mb4', cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor)
try:
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Calculate the average account balance of customers whose balance is greater than 0
        avg_balance_query = """
        SELECT AVG(C_ACCTBAL) FROM customer WHERE C_ACCTBAL > 0.00;
        """
        cursor.execute(avg_balance_query)
        avg_balance = cursor.fetchone()[0]

        # Find customers matching the criteria and calculate number and total balance
        sales_opp_query = """
        SELECT LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) AS CNTRYCODE, COUNT(*) AS NUM_CUST, SUM(C_ACCTBAL) AS TOTAL_BALANCE
        FROM customer WHERE LEFT(C_PHONE, 2) IN ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')
        AND C_CUSTKEY NOT IN (SELECT O_CUSTKEY FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERDATE > %s)
        AND C_ACCTBAL > %s
        GROUP BY CNTRYCODE ORDER BY CNTRYCODE ASC;
        """
        cursor.execute(sales_opp_query, (seven_years_ago.date(), avg_balance))
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write the results to a CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow(['CNTRYCODE', 'NUM_CUST', 'TOTAL_BALANCE'])
            for row in results:
                writer.writerow(row)
finally:
    conn.close()
```

Now, here's the Bash script to install all dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if not installed already
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Please ensure you run this script with appropriate permissions and in an environment where installation of packages is allowed.
