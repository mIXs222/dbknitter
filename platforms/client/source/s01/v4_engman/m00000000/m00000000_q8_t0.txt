The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order. Please output the columns in the order of order year and market share.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (query_code.py):

```python

try:

finally:
    connection.close()
```

And here's the bash script to install the dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Upgrade packages
apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql library using pip
pip3 install pymysql
