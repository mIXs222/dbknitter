Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person. The result only has one column, which is SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on your MySQL database and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import csv

# MySQL database connection information
db_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'database': 'tpch'
}

# Connect to MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host=db_info['host'],
                             user=db_info['user'],
                             password=db_info['password'],
                             database=db_info['database'])

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # SQL query to execute
        sql = """
        SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
        FROM lineitem, part
        WHERE 
        (
            (P_BRAND = 'Brand#12' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND L_QUANTITY >= 1 AND L_QUANTITY <= 11 AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
            OR
            (P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND L_QUANTITY >= 10 AND L_QUANTITY <= 20 AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
            OR
            (P_BRAND = 'Brand#34' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND L_QUANTITY >= 20 AND L_QUANTITY <= 30 AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15)
        )
        AND L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY
        AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
        AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
        """

        # Execute SQL query
        cursor.execute(sql)
        result = cursor.fetchone()

        # Write result to CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            writer.writerow(['REVENUE'])  # Header
            writer.writerow([result['REVENUE']])

finally:
    connection.close()
```

And here's the bash script to install the necessary dependencies for running the Python code above:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install python3 and pip if not already installed
apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install pymysql using pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Save the Python code in a file named `query.py` and the bash script in a file named `install_dependencies.sh`. Make sure to give execute permissions to your bash script using the command `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
