Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in EUROPE region, for each part of a BRASS type and size of 15, the supplier who can supply it at minimum supply cost. If several suppliers in that EUROPE offers the BRASS part and size of 15 at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the suppliers with the order by account balance in descending order, and nation name, supplier name, part key in ascending order. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information. Please output the columns in the order of N_NAME, P_MFGR, P_PARTKEY, S_ACCTBAL, S_ADDRESS, S_COMMENT, S_NAME, S_PHONE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Here is the Bash script (`setup.sh`) to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip3 if not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql library via pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

You can save each part of the code in their respective files (`.py` for Python code and `.sh` for the Bash script) and execute them on your server. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the bash script and install the packages.
