The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in ASIA. The query considers only parts ordered between 1990-01-01 and 1995-01-01. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)). Please output the columns in the order of N_NAME and REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code you requested to execute the query and write the results to `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymysql
import csv
from decimal import Decimal

# Connect to the MySQL server
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # Execute the query    
        sql_query = """
        SELECT 
            n.N_NAME,
            SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
        FROM
            nation n
        JOIN 
            region r ON n.N_REGIONKEY = r.R_REGIONKEY AND r.R_NAME = 'ASIA'
        JOIN 
            supplier s ON n.N_NATIONKEY = s.S_NATIONKEY
        JOIN 
            lineitem l ON s.S_SUPPKEY = l.L_SUPPKEY
        JOIN 
            orders o ON l.L_ORDERKEY = o.O_ORDERKEY 
        JOIN 
            customer c ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY AND c.C_NATIONKEY = n.N_NATIONKEY
        WHERE 
            o.O_ORDERDATE >= '1990-01-01' AND o.O_ORDERDATE < '1995-01-01'
        GROUP BY 
            n.N_NAME
        ORDER BY 
            REVENUE DESC;
        """
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write the result to a CSV file
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
            csvwriter.writerow(['N_NAME', 'REVENUE'])
            for row in result:
                csvwriter.writerow([row[0], str(Decimal(row[1]))])
finally:
    connection.close()
```

And now, the corresponding Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install python3, python3-pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql via pip
pip3 install pymysql
```
