message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmysql has database named tpch with tables: part, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mysql:\n- part: P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mysql, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- username: root\n- password: my-secret-pw\n- hostname: mysql\n- instruction: Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers only parts of BRAND#23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken? The output should be the average yearly loss.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code that you requested to execute the query.

**Python Code (query.py):**
```python
import pymysql
import csv

# Connection details
mysql_connection_info = {
    'host': 'mysql',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'my-secret-pw',
    'database': 'tpch'
}

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(**mysql_connection_info)
try:
    with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Calculate the average quantity of parts for the brand and container type
        avg_quantity_sql = """
        SELECT AVG(L_QUANTITY)
        FROM lineitem AS l
        JOIN part AS p ON l.L_PARTKEY = p.P_PARTKEY
        WHERE P_BRAND = 'BRAND#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'
        """
        cursor.execute(avg_quantity_sql)
        avg_quantity = cursor.fetchone()[0] if cursor.rowcount > 0 else 0

        # Calculate the yearly revenue loss assuming there's one less eligible order per year
        if avg_quantity > 0:
            loss_sql = """
            SELECT
                AVG((L_QUANTITY / %s) * L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS avg_yearly_loss
            FROM lineitem AS l
            JOIN part AS p ON l.L_PARTKEY = p.P_PARTKEY
            WHERE P_BRAND = 'BRAND#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG' AND L_QUANTITY < %s * 0.2
            """
            cursor.execute(loss_sql, (avg_quantity, avg_quantity))
            avg_yearly_loss = cursor.fetchone()[0] if cursor.rowcount > 0 else 0
        else:
            avg_yearly_loss = 0

    # Output result to a CSV file
    with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
        writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
        writer.writerow(['avg_yearly_loss'])
        writer.writerow([avg_yearly_loss])

finally:
    mysql_conn.close()
```

**Package Installation Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Upgrade pip and setuptools to ensure we can install dependencies properly
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# Install pymysql - Python package for connecting to MySQL databases
pip install pymysql
```

You will need to run the bash script to install the necessary dependencies before you can run the Python script. Remember to give execution permissions to the bash script:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the Python script to execute the query and save the output to `query_output.csv`:
```bash
python query.py
```
