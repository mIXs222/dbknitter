Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a nation which is SAUDI ARABIA, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order with current [status] of 'F' where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date. Multi-Supplier order means the same order has multiple lineitems that has different suppliers. Please output NUMWAIT and S_NAME columne in the order of number of await lineitems in descending order and S_NAME ascending.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your requested Python code:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import csv

# Connection info
conn_config = {
    "database": "tpch",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "my-secret-pw",
    "host": "mysql",
}

# Connect to the MySQL server
conn = pymysql.connect(**conn_config)
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NUMWAIT, S_NAME
FROM (
    SELECT L_ORDERKEY, S_NAME
    FROM lineitem
    JOIN orders ON L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
    JOIN supplier ON L_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY
    JOIN nation ON supplier.S_NATIONKEY = nation.N_NATIONKEY
    WHERE N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
    AND O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'
    AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE
    AND L_RECEIPTDATE > '1995-01-01'
    GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY, S_NAME
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT S_SUPPKEY) = 1
    AND COUNT(DISTINCT L_SUPPKEY) > 1
) AS subquery
GROUP BY S_NAME
ORDER BY NUMWAIT DESC, S_NAME ASC;
"""

cur.execute(query)

# Write results to a CSV file
with open("query_output.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(["NUMWAIT", "S_NAME"])  # header
    for row in cur.fetchall():
        writer.writerow(row)

# Close the connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install the required dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package manager
sudo apt update

# Upgrade any existing packages
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the PyMySQL library
pip3 install pymysql
