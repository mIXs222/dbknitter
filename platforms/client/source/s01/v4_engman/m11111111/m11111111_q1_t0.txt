message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped before 1998-09-02. The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code (query.py):
```python

# Execute the aggregation
result = db.lineitem.aggregate(pipeline)

# Write results to csv
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['RETURNFLAG', 'LINESTATUS', 'SUM_QTY', 'SUM_BASE_PRICE', 'SUM_DISC_PRICE',

```

And here is your bash script to install the dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install pip and Python development packages (if not already installed)
apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo
```

Make sure to make the bash script executable before running it by using the command:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
