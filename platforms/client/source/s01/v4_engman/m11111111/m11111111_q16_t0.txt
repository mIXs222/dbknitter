message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: part, supplier, partsupp\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- part: P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT\n- supplier: S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL, S_COMMENT\n- partsupp: PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY, PS_AVAILQTY, PS_SUPPLYCOST, PS_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query finds out how many suppliers can supply parts with given attributes. It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here's the Python code to execute the query using `pymongo`:

```python
# query.py
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# Database connection details
DB_NAME = "tpch"
DB_PORT = 27017
DB_HOST = "mongodb"

# Create MongoDB client
client = MongoClient(DB_HOST, DB_PORT)
db = client[DB_NAME]

# Query criteria for parts that are not of brand 45, not of size MEDIUM POLISHED and only parts of certain sizes
parts_query = {
    "P_BRAND": {"$ne": "Brand#45"},
    "P_TYPE": {"$not": {"$regex": "MEDIUM POLISHED.*"}},
    "P_SIZE": {"$in": [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]}
}

# Find all distinct suppliers that supply qualified parts 
qualified_part_keys = db.part.distinct("P_PARTKEY", parts_query)
qualified_suppliers = db.partsupp.find({
    "PS_PARTKEY": {"$in": qualified_part_keys},
    "PS_SUPPKEY": {"$nin": db.supplier.find({"S_COMMENT": {"$regex": ".*Customer.*Complaints.*"}}).distinct("S_SUPPKEY")}
}, {"PS_SUPPKEY": 1}).distinct("PS_SUPPKEY")

# Count the number of parts supplied by each supplier according to the given criteria
supplier_counts = db.part.aggregate([
    {"$match": parts_query},
    {"$lookup": {
        "from": "partsupp",
        "localField": "P_PARTKEY",
        "foreignField": "PS_PARTKEY",
        "as": "partsupp"
    }},
    {"$unwind": "$partsupp"},
    {"$match": {
        "partsupp.PS_SUPPKEY": {"$in": qualified_suppliers}
    }},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": {
            "P_BRAND": "$P_BRAND",
            "P_TYPE": "$P_TYPE",
            "P_SIZE": "$P_SIZE"
        },
        "count": {"$sum": 1}
    }},
    {"$sort": {
        "count": -1,
        "_id.P_BRAND": 1,
        "_id.P_TYPE": 1,
        "_id.P_SIZE": 1
    }}
])

# Write results to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'SUPPLIER_COUNT']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()

    for doc in supplier_counts:
        row = {
            'P_BRAND': doc['_id']['P_BRAND'],
            'P_TYPE': doc['_id']['P_TYPE'],
            'P_SIZE': doc['_id']['P_SIZE'],
            'SUPPLIER_COUNT': doc['count']
        }
        writer.writerow(row)
```
