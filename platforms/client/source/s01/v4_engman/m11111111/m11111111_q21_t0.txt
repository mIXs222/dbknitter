message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: nation, supplier, orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- nation: N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME, N_REGIONKEY, N_COMMENT\n- supplier: S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL, S_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a nation which is SAUDI ARABIA, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order with current [status] of 'F' where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date. Multi-Supplier order means the same order has multiple lineitems that has different suppliers. Please output NUMWAIT and S_NAME columne in the order of number of await lineitems in descending order and S_NAME ascending.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure pip is installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo
```

Make sure to give the Bash script execution permission with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
