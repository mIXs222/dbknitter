The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install python3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo module
pip3 install pymongo
```

Make sure to provide execution permissions to the Bash script by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Then you can execute the script to install the dependencies:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```
