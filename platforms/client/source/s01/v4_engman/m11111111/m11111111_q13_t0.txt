message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (save as `mongodb_query.py`):

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
db = client.tpch

# Query MongoDB to get customer order counts excluding pending and deposits
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"O_COMMENT": {"$not": {"$regex": ".*pending.*deposits.*"}}}},
    {"$group": {"_id": "$O_CUSTKEY", "order_count": {"$sum": 1}}},
    {"$group": {"_id": "$order_count", "customer_count": {"$sum": 1}}},
    {"$sort": {"_id": 1}}
]

orders_count = db.orders.aggregate(pipeline)

# Write results to query_output.csv
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Number of Orders', 'Number of Customers'])
    for doc in orders_count:
        writer.writerow([doc["_id"], doc["customer_count"]])

client.close()
```
And here's the bash script to install all dependencies (save as `install_deps.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip (if not already installed)
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo
pip3 install pymongo
