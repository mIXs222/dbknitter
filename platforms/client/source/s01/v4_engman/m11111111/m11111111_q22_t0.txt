message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmongodb has database named tpch with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mongodb:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with mongodb, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- port: 27017\n- hostname: mongodb\n- instruction: Use 'pymongo' to connect to the mongodb server.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase. This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the query using pymongo. Save this as `global_sales_opportunity.py`:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connection details
host = 'mongodb'
port = 27017
dbname = 'tpch'

# Establish a connection to the MongoDB server
client = MongoClient(host, port)
db = client[dbname]

# Retrieve customers and orders into memory
customers = list(db.customer.find({}))
orders = list(db.orders.find({}))

# Filter out customers by the specified country codes
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
filtered_customers = [c for c in customers if c['C_PHONE'][:2] in country_codes]

# Get the current date and calculate the date 7 years ago
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)

# Find all customers who have not ordered for 7 years
customers_without_orders = [
    c for c in filtered_customers if not any(
        o['O_CUSTKEY'] == c['C_CUSTKEY'] and datetime.strptime(o['O_ORDERDATE'], "%Y-%m-%d") > seven_years_ago
        for o in orders
    )
]

# Calculate the average account balance for customers with positive balance
average_balance = (
    sum(c['C_ACCTBAL'] for c in filtered_customers if c['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0) /
    sum(1 for c in filtered_customers if c['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0)
)

# Filter customers by the average account balance
target_customers = [
    c for c in customers_without_orders if c['C_ACCTBAL'] > average_balance
]

# Aggregate results by country code
results = {}
for c in target_customers:
    cntrycode = c['C_PHONE'][:2]
    if cntrycode not in results:
        results[cntrycode] = {'count': 0, 'total_balance': 0}
    results[cntrycode]['count'] += 1
    results[cntrycode]['total_balance'] += c['C_ACCTBAL']

# Sort results by CNTRYCODE ascending
sorted_results = sorted(results.items())

# Write results to query_output.csv
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['CNTRYCODE', 'CUSTOMER_COUNT', 'TOTAL_BALANCE']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    for cntrycode, data in sorted_results:
        writer.writerow({
            'CNTRYCODE': cntrycode,
            'CUSTOMER_COUNT': data['count'],
            'TOTAL_BALANCE': data['total_balance']
        })
```

And here's the Bash script to install pymongo and run the Python code. Save this as `setup_and_run.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install pymongo
pip install pymongo

# Run the python script
python global_sales_opportunity.py
```

Make sure to give execution permissions to the Bash script after creating the file:

```bash
chmod +x setup_and_run.sh
```
