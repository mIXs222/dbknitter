It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers.

2. Here is the Bash script that you can save as `install_dependencies.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python MySQL client library
pip install pymysql

# Install Python MongoDB client library
pip install pymongo
```

Don't forget to give execute permissions to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` in your terminal before running it.
