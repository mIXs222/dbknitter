The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code that will execute the query:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis
import csv

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Redis connection setup
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve promotion parts from MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_RETAILPRICE
FROM part
WHERE P_RETAILPRICE > 0 AND P_NAME LIKE 'PROMO%'
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)
promotion_parts = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cursor.fetchall(), columns=['P_PARTKEY', 'P_RETAILPRICE'])

# Retrieve lineitem data from Redis within the specified date range
start_date = '1995-09-01'
end_date = '1995-10-01'
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Filter line items with dates within the desired range.
lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'])
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[(lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= start_date) & (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= end_date)]

# Merge two DataFrames on part key
merged_df = pd.merge(filtered_lineitem_df, promotion_parts, how='inner', left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Calculate revenue for promotion parts and total revenue
merged_df['REVENUE'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
total_promo_revenue = sum(merged_df['REVENUE'])
total_revenue = sum(filtered_lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT']))

# Calculate and store the percentage of promo revenue
percentage_promo_revenue = 0 if total_revenue == 0 else (total_promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100
result = [{'percentage_promo_revenue': percentage_promo_revenue}]

# Write the result to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=result[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(result)

# Close MySQL cursor and connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
```

2. Here is the Bash script to install the dependencies:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql
pip install pandas
pip install direct-redis
