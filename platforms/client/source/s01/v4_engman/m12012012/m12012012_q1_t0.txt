The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Establish connection to the Redis database
r = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve the 'lineitem' table
lineitem_data = r.get('lineitem')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(lineitem_data)

# Apply the filters and group by requirements of the report
filtered_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < '1998-09-02']
aggregation = {
    'L_QUANTITY': ['sum', 'mean'],
    'L_EXTENDEDPRICE': ['sum', 'mean'],
    'L_DISCOUNT': 'mean',
    'L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE': lambda x: sum(x * (1 - filtered_df.loc[x.index, 'L_DISCOUNT'])),
    'L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE_PLUS_TAX': lambda x: sum(x * (1 - filtered_df.loc[x.index, 'L_DISCOUNT']) * (1 + filtered_df.loc[x.index, 'L_TAX'])),
    'L_RETURNFLAG': 'count'
}

filtered_df['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE_PLUS_TAX'] = filtered_df['L_DISCOUNTED_PRICE'] * (1 + filtered_df['L_TAX'])

grouped_df = filtered_df.groupby(['L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS']).agg(aggregation).reset_index()
grouped_df.columns = [ # Flatten the MultiIndex columns

# Sort the results as instructed
sorted_df = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['L_RETURNFLAG', 'L_LINESTATUS'])

```

### Bash Script (setup.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3

# Install pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pandas redis

# Install direct_redis (assumes direct_redis is a package that can be installed, 
# if not, additional steps would be required to obtain it)
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please note that the `pandas` library does not support direct connection to Redis. The code provided assumes that the `DirectRedis` class interfaces with Redis and provides a JSON response that can be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, which is not standard functionality provided by `redis-py` or `pandas`. The installation instructions within the bash script for `direct_redis` may also differ based on how this (hypothetical) package is distributed and installed.
