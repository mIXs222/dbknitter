Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person. The result only has one column, which is SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to execute the multi-database query and write the output to `query_output.csv`:

```python
# multi_database_query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Query parts from MySQL
mysql_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_BRAND, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER
FROM part
WHERE (P_BRAND = 'Brand#12' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
   OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
   OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#34' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15)
"""
parts_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Redis connection
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query lineitems from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'))

# Merging and filtering DataFrames
result_df = lineitem_df.merge(parts_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Apply additional filters and calculate the revenues
result_df = result_df[
    ((result_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#12') & result_df['L_QUANTITY'].between(1, 11)) |
    ((result_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & result_df['L_QUANTITY'].between(10, 20)) |
    ((result_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#34') & result_df['L_QUANTITY'].between(20, 30))
]
result_df = result_df[result_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['AIR', 'AIR REG'])]
result_df['REVENUE'] = result_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - result_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate the sum of the revenue
final_result = result_df[['REVENUE']].sum()

# Output to csv file
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

``` 

Next, here's the bash script for installing the dependencies to run above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list and install Python3 and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python library dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis

# Note: Additional system dependencies might be required. This script assumes that Python3 and pip are not installed.
