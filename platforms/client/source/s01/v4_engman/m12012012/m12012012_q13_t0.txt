This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code to fulfill your request:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql.cursors
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch')

# Connect to MongoDB database
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Query MySQL to fetch customer information
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT C_CUSTKEY FROM customer")
customer_ids = [row[0] for row in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]
mysql_cursor.close()

# Query MongoDB to fetch order information
orders_collection = mongo_db['orders']
order_count_by_customer = orders_collection.aggregate([
    {
        '$match': {
            'O_ORDERSTATUS': {'$nin': ['pending', 'deposits']},
            'O_COMMENT': {'$not': {'$regex': '.*pending.*deposits.*'}}
        }
    },
    {
        '$group': {
            '_id': '$O_CUSTKEY',
            'order_count': {'$sum': 1}
        }
    },
    {
        '$match': {
            '_id': {'$in': customer_ids}
        }
    },
    {
        '$group': {
            '_id': '$order_count',
            'customer_count': {'$sum': 1}
        }
    },
    {
        '$sort': {'_id': 1}
    }
])

# Write query results to file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['OrderCount', 'CustomerCount'])
    for doc in order_count_by_customer:
        writer.writerow([doc['_id'], doc['customer_count']])

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MySQL client
apt-get install -y default-mysql-client

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please ensure that the file permissions are correct for the bash script by running:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Remember to run this script as a user with administrative privileges because it uses `apt-get`.
