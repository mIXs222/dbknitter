We only consider line items that are actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the l_receiptdate should exceeds the l_commitdate, the ship mode should be in 'mail' or 'ship'. Also, only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The output results are grouped and ordered by l_shipmode in ascending order. For each group, we also count the number of lineitems of high order priority (those with priority URGENT or HIGH), and the number of lineitems of low order priority  (with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on your original data:

```python
# python_code.py
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient(host="mongodb", port=27017)
db = client['tpch']
orders_collection = db['orders']
# Query orders collection and convert to Pandas DataFrame
query = {
    'O_ORDERDATE': {'$gte': pd.Timestamp('1994-01-01'), '$lt': pd.Timestamp('1995-01-01')},
    'O_ORDERPRIORITY': {'$in': ['URGENT', 'HIGH']}
}
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_collection.find(query, projection={'_id': False, 'O_ORDERKEY': True, 'O_ORDERPRIORITY': True})))

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)
# Get lineitem table from Redis and convert to Pandas DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Perform analysis
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < '1995-01-01') &
    (lineitem_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > lineitem_df['L_COMMITDATE']) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP']))
]

# Merge DataFrames on order key
joined_df = pd.merge(filtered_lineitem_df, orders_df, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY', how='inner')

# Group by L_SHIPMODE and count the number of lineitems for each priority
result_df = joined_df.groupby(['L_SHIPMODE', 'O_ORDERPRIORITY']).size().reset_index(name='count')
result_df = result_df.pivot_table(index=['L_SHIPMODE'], columns='O_ORDERPRIORITY', values='count').reset_index()
result_df.columns.name = None
result_df = result_df.fillna(0).sort_values(by="L_SHIPMODE")

# Write the result to a CSV file
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the bash script to install all dependencies needed to run the python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update packages and install pip
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas

# Since the direct_redis package is not standard, it would typically be hosted somewhere
# For this script, we'll assume you have direct access to the package
# The following line should be modified if the 'direct_redis.DirectRedis' is accessible through PyPI or another source
git clone <direct_redis_repository_url>
cd <direct_redis_repository_dir>
pip3 install .
```

Please replace `<direct_redis_repository_url>` and `<direct_redis_repository_dir>` with the actual URL and directory name of the `direct_redis` package. If the `direct_redis` package is available via PyPI or another Python package index, you can install it using `pip3 install` directly in the bash script.
