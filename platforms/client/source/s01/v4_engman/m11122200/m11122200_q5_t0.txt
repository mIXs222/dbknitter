The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in ASIA. The query considers only parts ordered between 1990-01-01 and 1995-01-01. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)). Please output the columns in the order of N_NAME and REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code to execute the described query:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
from datetime import datetime
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = DirectRedis(
    host='redis',
    port=6379,
    db=0
)

# Get the nations and regions from MongoDB
nation_cursor = mongo_db.nation.find({'N_REGIONKEY': {"$in": [mongo_db.region.find_one({'R_NAME': 'ASIA'})['R_REGIONKEY']]}})
asian_nations = {doc['N_NATIONKEY']: doc['N_NAME'] for doc in nation_cursor}

# Fetch supplier keys for nations in ASIA
supplier_keys = eval(redis_connection.get('supplier'))
asian_supplier_keys = {int(row['S_SUPPKEY']): row['S_NATIONKEY'] for row in supplier_keys if row['S_NATIONKEY'] in asian_nations}

# Fetch customer keys for nations in ASIA
customer_keys = eval(redis_connection.get('customer'))
asian_customer_keys = {int(row['C_CUSTKEY']): row['C_NATIONKEY'] for row in customer_keys if row['C_NATIONKEY'] in asian_nations}

# MySQL query to fetch lineitem and order data
mysql_cursor.execute("""
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    O_CUSTKEY
FROM
    lineitem
JOIN
    orders ON L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
WHERE
    O_ORDERDATE >= '1990-01-01' AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-01-01'
""")
lineitem_orders = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Calculate REVENUE for each nation from lineitem and customer data
revenues = {}
for row in lineitem_orders:
    orderkey, price, discount, custkey = row
    if custkey in asian_customer_keys:
        nationkey = asian_customer_keys[custkey]
        revenue = price * (1 - discount)
        if nationkey in revenues:
            revenues[nationkey] += revenue
        else:
            revenues[nationkey] = revenue

# Prepare the final results
results = [{'N_NAME': asian_nations[nationkey], 'REVENUE': revenue} 
           for nationkey, revenue in revenues.items() if nationkey in asian_supplier_keys]

# Sort by REVENUE in descending order
results.sort(key=lambda x: x['REVENUE'], reverse=True)

# Create a DataFrame and write to CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(results)
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close all connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is your Bash script for installing dependencies:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories and install Python and pip if needed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct-redis
```

Save these files with appropriate names, for example `query_execution.py` for the Python script, and `install_dependencies.sh` for the Bash script, and run them in your environment.
