This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (e.g. `query_executor.py`) to execute the described query:

```python
import csv
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Retrieve orders data from MySQL
orders_query = """
    SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) as order_count
    FROM orders
    WHERE O_ORDERSTATUS NOT IN ('P', 'D')
    AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'
    GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
"""
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(orders_query)
    orders_result = cursor.fetchall()

# Put orders result into DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_result, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'order_count'])

# Connect to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve customer data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('customer'), orient='records')

# Merge orders data with customer data on customer key
merged_df = pd.merge(customer_df, orders_df, on='C_CUSTKEY', how='left').fillna(0)

# Group by order count to get distribution of customers
distribution_df = merged_df.groupby('order_count').size().reset_index(name='customer_count')

# Write the query result to a csv file
distribution_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the connections
mysql_conn.close()
```

And here is the corresponding bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all the required dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install system dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct-redis
