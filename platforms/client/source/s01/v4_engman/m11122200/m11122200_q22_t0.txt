This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (`query.py`) to execute the query on your original data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Redis connection
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch orders from the last 7 years
seven_years_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
mysql_sql = f"""
SELECT O_CUSTKEY
FROM orders
WHERE O_ORDERDATE >= '{seven_years_ago}'
"""
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_sql)
    recent_orders = cursor.fetchall()

# Create a dataframe for orders
recent_orders_df = pd.DataFrame(recent_orders, columns=['O_CUSTKEY'])
recent_customers = set(recent_orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'])

# Get customer data from Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('customer'), orient='records')

# Process customers that have not placed orders in the last 7 years
customer_df = customer_df[~customer_df['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(recent_customers)]

# Account balance conditions
customer_df = customer_df[customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.00]

# Average account balance for people in specific countries
avg_balance_by_country = customer_df.groupby(customer_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2])['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().to_dict()

# Define the country codes to search for
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']

# Filter for those country codes and account balance conditions

# Close connection
mysql_conn.close()

```

Below is the required Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install Python and pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql, direct_redis, and pandas
pip3 install pymysql
pip3 install direct_redis
pip3 install pandas
