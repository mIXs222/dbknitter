Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person. The result only has one column, which is SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Below is the Python code (`query_code.py`) that you can use to execute the specified query across the different databases and write the result to `query_output.csv`:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Define the criteria for the types as tuples containing the brand, containers, and size range
types_criteria = [
    ('Brand#12', ['SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG'], (1, 5)),
    ('Brand#23', ['MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK'], (1, 10)),
    ('Brand#34', ['LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG'], (1, 15))
]

# Query MongoDB to get a list of all Partkeys that match the criteria.
matching_partkeys = []
for brand, containers, sizes in types_criteria:
    mongo_query = {
        "P_BRAND": brand,
        "P_CONTAINER": {"$in": containers},
        "P_SIZE": {"$gte": sizes[0], "$lte": sizes[1]}
    }
    partkeys = mongo_db.part.find(mongo_query, {"P_PARTKEY": 1})
    partkeys = [p["P_PARTKEY"] for p in partkeys]
    matching_partkeys.extend(partkeys)

# MySQL query to find the revenue
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()
mysql_query = """
SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
FROM lineitem
WHERE
    L_PARTKEY IN (%s) AND
    L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
    L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
"""
in_clause = ', '.join(map(str, matching_partkeys))
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query % in_clause)
revenue = mysql_cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Write the output to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['REVENUE'])
    writer.writerow([revenue])

mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all the dependencies for the Python script to run:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories and prepare the system
apt-get update -y

# Install pip for Python3 and MongoDB server
apt-get install -y python3-pip mongodb-server

# Install pymysql and pymongo using pip
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Don't forget to give execution permission to the bash script by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`.
