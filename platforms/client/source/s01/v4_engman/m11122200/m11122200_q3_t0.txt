Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. Please output the columns in the order of O_ORDERKEY, REVENUE, O_ORDERDATE, and O_SHIPPRIORITY.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
