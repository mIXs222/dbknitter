All the considered orders should have total quantity of larger than 300. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. And the result is order by O_TOTALPRICE in descending and O_ORDERDATE in ascending.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the given query:

```python

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',

    db='tpch'
)

"""
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(order_query)
    order_results = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert orders query results to DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(order_results, columns=['C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'TOTAL_QUANTITY'])

```

Below is the Bash script to install all required dependencies to run the Python code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pandas
pip3 install pymysql pandas

# Install direct_redis (This package name is hypothetical, as there is no such known package with exact this name.
# Replace 'direct_redis' with the correct package name if it exists, or install the package based on your source of direct_redis.)
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please note that `direct_redis` may not exist as a standard package, this script assumes that such a package exists or that you have a local version to install. If `direct_redis` is not a standard package, please provide the archive file or installation instructions, or install it using the approach specified for the package.
