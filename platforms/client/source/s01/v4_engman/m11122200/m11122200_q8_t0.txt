The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order. Please output the columns in the order of order year and market share.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code that fulfills your requirements:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def fetch_mysql_data():
    conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', passwd='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
    sql_query = """

        DATE_FORMAT(O_ORDERDATE, '%%Y') AS order_year, 
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue

        orders
    JOIN 
        lineitem ON O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
    WHERE 
        DATE_FORMAT(O_ORDERDATE, '%%Y') IN ('1995', '1996')
    GROUP BY 
        order_year
    """
    df_mysql = pd.read_sql(sql_query, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df_mysql

def fetch_mongodb_data():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
    db = client['tpch']
    nation_data = list(db.nation.find({"N_NAME": "INDIA"}, {"_id": 0, "N_NATIONKEY": 1}))
    nation_keys = [item['N_NATIONKEY'] for item in nation_data]
    client.close()
    return nation_keys

def fetch_redis_data(nation_keys):
    dr = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    supplier_data = pd.read_json(dr.get('supplier').decode('utf-8'))
    indian_suppliers = supplier_data[supplier_data['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(nation_keys)]['S_SUPPKEY'].tolist()
    return indian_suppliers

def calculate_market_share(df_mysql, indian_suppliers):
    df_mysql['market_share'] = df_mysql.apply(lambda x: x['revenue'] if x['O_SUPPKEY'] in indian_suppliers else 0, axis=1)
    df_mysql['market_share'] = df_mysql['market_share'] / df_mysql['revenue'].sum()
    result = df_mysql[['order_year', 'market_share']]
    return result

# Fetch data from different databases
df_mysql = fetch_mysql_data()
nation_keys = fetch_mongodb_data()
indian_suppliers = fetch_redis_data(nation_keys)

# Calculate market share
result = calculate_market_share(df_mysql, indian_suppliers)

# Write output to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the corresponding bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Please note that the dependencies may differ based on the actual programming environment and system configuration. The bash script provided assumes a Debian/Ubuntu-based system environment. Also, the provided Python code assumes a certain functionality of the `direct_redis` library which might not be an actual library. Make sure to replace it with appropriate code to interact with Redis and fetch the data correctly.
