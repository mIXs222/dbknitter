It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python code (`query_code.py`):

with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(cust_query, (avg_balance,))
    customer_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert customer data into a DataFrame

```

2. Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql redis pandas direct-redis
```

Please note that you will need to have pip installed, and you might need to adjust permissions (e.g., using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`) to run the bash script. Also, the operation may require `sudo` privileges, depending on the user's permissions and the system setup. If needed, prepend `sudo` to the `pip install` command. The Python script assumes that the connection details provided are correct and that the Redis module for Python is modified to provide the specified behavior.
