The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.

Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is your Python code (`query.py`) which addresses the data split across different platforms to execute the described query:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch'
)

# Execute MySQL Query
sql_query = """SELECT L_ORDERKEY 
               FROM lineitem 
               WHERE L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE;"""
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(sql_query)
    late_orders = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert MySQL results into DataFrame
late_order_keys = [order[0] for order in late_orders]
df_late_orders = pd.DataFrame(late_order_keys, columns=['O_ORDERKEY'])

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Redis Connection
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get orders DataFrame from Redis
df_orders_redis = redis_conn.get('orders')
df_orders_redis['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df_orders_redis['O_ORDERDATE'])

# Filtering orders between specific dates
filtered_orders = df_orders_redis[(df_orders_redis['O_ORDERDATE'] >= '1993-07-01') &
                                  (df_orders_redis['O_ORDERDATE'] <= '1993-10-01')]

# Find late received orders
late_orders_df = filtered_orders[filtered_orders['O_ORDERKEY'].isin(df_late_orders['O_ORDERKEY'])]

# Count such orders for each order priority
order_priority_counts = late_orders_df.groupby('O_ORDERPRIORITY').size().reset_index(name='ORDER_COUNT')

# Sort by order priority
order_priority_counts = order_priority_counts.sort_values(by='O_ORDERPRIORITY')

# Write to CSV
order_priority_counts.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is your Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Direct Redis and its dependencies (redis-py requires to be installed first)
pip3 install redis
pip3 install direct-redis

# Install PyMySQL
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

Remember to grant execute permission to the bash script with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
