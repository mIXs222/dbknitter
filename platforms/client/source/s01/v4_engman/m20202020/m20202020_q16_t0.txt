It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you should save as `execute_query.py`:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host="mysql",
                                   user="root",
                                   password="my-secret-pw",
                                   database="tpch")
try:
    # Get 'supplier' table where S_COMMENT does not indicate a complaint
    with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
        SELECT S_SUPPKEY FROM supplier
        WHERE S_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
        """)
        suppliers_without_complaints = cursor.fetchall()

finally:
    mysql_connection.close()

# Convert suppliers list to a DataFrame
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(suppliers_without_complaints, columns=["S_SUPPKEY"])

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379)

# Get 'part' and 'partsupp' tables and convert to DataFrames
part_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_connection.get('part'))
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_connection.get('partsupp'))

# Filter 'part' DataFrame for the required specifications
parts_filtered_df = part_df[
    (part_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9])) &
    (part_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45') &
    (part_df['P_TYPE'].str.contains('MEDIUM POLISHED', regex=False) == False)
]

# Merge 'partsupp' with filtered parts
partsupp_filtered_df = partsupp_df.merge(parts_filtered_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Join 'partsupp' with 'supplier' on S_SUPPKEY and PS_SUPPKEY
result_df = partsupp_filtered_df.merge(supplier_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Group by P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE and count distinct suppliers
final_df = result_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']) \
    .agg({'S_SUPPKEY': 'nunique'}) \
    .reset_index() \
    .rename(columns={'S_SUPPKEY': 'SupplierCount'}) \
    .sort_values(by=['SupplierCount', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])

# Write final results to CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script that you should save as `install_dependencies.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories and upgrade any existing packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install direct-redis
```

Make sure to give executable permissions to the bash script before running it:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

After having all the dependencies installed, you can run the Python script to execute your query and generate the `query_output.csv` file.
