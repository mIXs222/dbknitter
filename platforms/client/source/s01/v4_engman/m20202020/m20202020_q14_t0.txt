The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories and install pip if it's not installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct-redis

Make sure to give execution permission to the bash script before running it:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
