# Execute MySQL query
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    suppliers_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert to DataFrame
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(suppliers_data, columns=['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'total_quantity'])

# Get the nation table from Redis
nation_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('nation').decode('utf-8'))

# Filter for Canada nation key
canada_nation_key = nation_df[nation_df['N_NAME'] == 'CANADA']['N_NATIONKEY'].iloc[0]

# Get the partsupp table from Redis
partsupp_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('partsupp').decode('utf-8'))

final_df = supplier_df.merge(partsupp_df, how='inner', left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='PS_SUPPKEY')

final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the connections
mysql_conn.close()
redis_conn.close()
```

And here's the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update package list and install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas redis direct-redis
```

Please make sure the `install_dependencies.sh` script has the execute permission by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`. Additionally, the Python script assumes that `direct_redis` can directly work with `get('tablename')` to get DataFrame, which is a hypothetical situation requiring a custom implementation of `DirectRedis` that is compatible with Redis but returns data in a way that can be directly consumed as Pandas DataFrame.
