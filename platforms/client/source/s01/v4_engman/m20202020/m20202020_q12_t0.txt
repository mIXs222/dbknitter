We only consider line items that are actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the l_receiptdate should exceeds the l_commitdate, the ship mode should be in 'mail' or 'ship'. Also, only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The output results are grouped and ordered by l_shipmode in ascending order. For each group, we also count the number of lineitems of high order priority (those with priority URGENT or HIGH), and the number of lineitems of low order priority  (with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can save with a `.py` extension, for example `data_query.py`:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', database='tpch')

# MySQL query to get the relevant lineitem data
lineitem_query = """
SELECT L_SHIPMODE, L_LINENUMBER, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_SHIPDATE, L_ORDERKEY
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_RECEIPTDATE BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1995-01-01'
  AND L_RECEIPTDATE > L_COMMITDATE
  AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')
  AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE
"""

lineitem_data = pd.read_sql(lineitem_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis database
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get the orders data from Redis
orders_df = pd.read_msgpack(redis_conn.get('orders'))

# Combining data
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_data, orders_df, how='inner', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Filter by priority and calculate counts
merged_df['HIGH_PRIORITY'] = merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].isin(['URGENT', 'HIGH']).astype(int)
merged_df['LOW_PRIORITY'] = (~merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].isin(['URGENT', 'HIGH'])).astype(int)

result = merged_df.groupby('L_SHIPMODE').agg(
    High_Priority_Count=('HIGH_PRIORITY', 'sum'),
    Low_Priority_Count=('LOW_PRIORITY', 'sum'),
).reset_index()

result.sort_values('L_SHIPMODE', ascending=True, inplace=True)

# Write the results to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies, which you can save as `setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Make sure to execute this script with root privileges

# Update package lists
apt update

# Install Python if not already installed
apt install -y python3

# Install pip if not already installed
apt install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis
```

Before running the bash script, make sure to give it executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

You can then run the bash script to install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

And execute the Python script with:

```bash
python3 data_query.py
```
