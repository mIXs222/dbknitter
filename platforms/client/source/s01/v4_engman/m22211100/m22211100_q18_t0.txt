All the considered orders should have total quantity of larger than 300. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. And the result is order by O_TOTALPRICE in descending and O_ORDERDATE in ascending.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Here's the Bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
# Filename: setup.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create a virtual environment and activate it
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# Update pip and install Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pymysql==1.0.2 pymongo==4.1.1

# Run the python script
python query.py
```

Ensure both the Python file and the Bash script have execution permissions:
```bash
chmod +x query.py
chmod +x setup.sh
```
