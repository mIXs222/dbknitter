Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date. We only consider line items that are actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the l_receiptdate should exceeds the l_commitdate, the ship mode should be in 'mail' or 'ship'. Also, only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The output results are grouped and ordered by l_shipmode in ascending order. For each group, we also count the number of lineitems of high order priority (those with priority URGENT or HIGH), and the number of lineitems of low order priority  (with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code that you can save to a `.py` file:

```python
# query_execution.py
import pymysql
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Establish a connection to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             database='tpch',
                             charset='utf8mb4',
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor)

try:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        query = """
        SELECT l_shipmode, 
               SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority = 'URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = 'HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_priority_count,
               SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority NOT IN ('URGENT', 'HIGH') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_priority_count
        FROM lineitem
        JOIN orders ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey 
        WHERE l_receiptdate BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1995-01-01'
          AND l_receiptdate > l_commitdate
          AND l_shipmode IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')
          AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate
        GROUP BY l_shipmode
        ORDER BY l_shipmode ASC;
        """
        cursor.execute(query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Write query results to CSV
        with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            writer.writerow(['l_shipmode', 'high_priority_count', 'low_priority_count'])
            for row in results:
                writer.writerow(row)

finally:
    connection.close()
```

Now, here is the bash script to install Python 3 and the required dependencies. Save this to a `.sh` file:

```bash
# setup.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Updates package lists, installs python3, python3-pip and pymysql
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

Remember to give execute permissions to your bash script before running it using the command `chmod +x setup.sh`. Then you can run it using `./setup.sh` to install the necessary dependencies. After running this script, you can execute the Python script `.py` to perform the query and generate the CSV.
