The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

`setup.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install dependencies for query.py

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python (just assuming Python is not installed on the system)
apt-get install -y python3

# Install pip (assuming pip is not present)
apt-get install -y python3-pip
