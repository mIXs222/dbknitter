This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code (`query_code.py`) that will execute the query on data from different databases and combine the results:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch',
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get a list of customer IDs from MongoDB
customer_ids = mongo_db.customer.find({}, {"C_CUSTKEY": 1, "_id": 0})
customer_id_list = [cust_doc['C_CUSTKEY'] for cust_doc in customer_ids]

# Get order information from MySQL
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    order_query = """
        SELECT O_CUSTKEY, COUNT(*) as order_count
        FROM orders
        WHERE O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'
        GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY;
    """
    cursor.execute(order_query)
    orders_by_customer = cursor.fetchall()

# Process results for output
order_counts = {}
for (cust_key, order_count) in orders_by_customer:
    if cust_key in customer_id_list:
        order_counts.setdefault(order_count, 0)
        order_counts[order_count] += 1

# Write results to CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csvwriter.writerow(['Number of Orders', 'Number of Customers'])
    for num_orders, num_customers in order_counts.items():
        csvwriter.writerow([num_orders, num_customers])

# Close the MySQL connection
mysql_connection.close()
```

Here is the requested Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies for the Python code above:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Make sure to update and upgrade the package lists from the repositories
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Make sure pip is installed
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

# Install PyMySQL (MySQL Python client)
pip3 install pymysql

# Install PyMongo (MongoDB Python client)
pip3 install pymongo
```

Remember to give the bash script execution permissions by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
