This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install PyMySQL and PyMongo
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please make sure to give execute permissions to the Bash script after creating it by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` and then you can execute it by running `./install_dependencies.sh`. Also, please adjust the Python script and Bash script to comply with your environment's specific pathing, permissions, and usage requirements.
