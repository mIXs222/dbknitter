response, Here is the Python code, assuming you have a CSV export functionality available for your Redis database:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
# Prepare the MySQL query
mysql_query = """
SELECT
    S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_PHONE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM
    supplier
JOIN
    lineitem ON supplier.S_SUPPKEY = lineitem.L_SUPPKEY
WHERE
    L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01' AND L_SHIPDATE < '1996-04-01'
GROUP BY
    S_SUPPKEY
ORDER BY
    TOTAL_REVENUE DESC, S_SUPPKEY
"""

# Read from MySQL
supplier_revenue_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
# Close the MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
# Read the lineitem table as a CSV string from Redis
lineitem_csv = redis_client.get('lineitem')
# Convert the CSV string to a DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.read_csv(pd.compat.StringIO(lineitem_csv))

# Merge the data from Redis with the MySQL DataFrame
merged_df = supplier_revenue_df.merge(lineitem_df, on='L_SUPPKEY')

# Calculate the top suppliers by total revenue
top_suppliers_df = merged_df.groupby(
    ['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE']
).agg({
    'TOTAL_REVENUE': 'max'
}).reset_index()

# Sort by total revenue and suppkey
top_suppliers_df = top_suppliers_df.sort_values(by=['TOTAL_REVENUE', 'S_SUPPKEY'], ascending=[False, True])

# Get the highest revenue
max_revenue = top_suppliers_df['TOTAL_REVENUE'].max()

# Filter for suppliers tied for the highest revenue
top_suppliers_df = top_suppliers_df[top_suppliers_df['TOTAL_REVENUE'] == max_revenue]

# Write to CSV
top_suppliers_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas
pip3 install direct-redis
```

Please note that the specific instructions for Redis's DirectRedis integration may require additional setup for CSV export functionality, which is not covered by the standard Redis client library or the description provided. The CSV export functionality for Redis data would need to be custom-implemented or provided by an additional library that may not exist.
