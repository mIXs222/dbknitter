The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order. Please output the columns in the order of order year and market share.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that will execute the query:

```python
# execute_query.py

import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Setup MySQL connection
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
    cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.Cursor
)

# Setup DirectRedis connection
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Function to execute a query in MySQL and return a dataframe
def fetch_mysql(query):
  with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
      cursor.execute(query)
      columns = [col[0] for col in cursor.description]
      data = cursor.fetchall()
      return pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)

# Function to fetch redis table and return a dataframe
def fetch_redis(table_name):
  data = eval(redis_connection.get(table_name).decode('utf-8'))
  return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Fetch required tables from MySQL
nation_df = fetch_mysql("SELECT * FROM nation")
region_df = fetch_mysql("SELECT * FROM region")
supplier_df = fetch_mysql("SELECT * FROM supplier")

# Fetch required tables from Redis
lineitem_df = fetch_redis('lineitem')

# Filter region and nation to include only those in Asia and India respectively
region_df = region_df[region_df.R_NAME == 'ASIA']
nation_df = nation_df[nation_df.N_NAME == 'INDIA']

# Get suppliers from India
indian_suppliers = supplier_df[supplier_df.S_NATIONKEY.isin(nation_df.N_NATIONKEY)]

# Merge tables to get the Asian suppliers information 
asian_lineitems = lineitem_df.merge(indian_suppliers, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Filtering for the product type 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'
asian_lineitems = asian_lineitems[asian_lineitems.P_TYPE == 'SMALL PLATED COPPER']

# Calculate the revenue
asian_lineitems['revenue'] = asian_lineitems.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - asian_lineitems.L_DISCOUNT)

# only consider the years 1995 and 1996
asian_lineitems = asian_lineitems[asian_lineitems.L_SHIPDATE.str.contains('1995|1996')]

# Calculate market share for years
market_share = asian_lineitems.groupby(asian_lineitems.L_SHIPDATE.str[:4])['revenue'].sum().reset_index()
market_share.columns = ['order_year', 'market_share']

# Output to CSV
market_share.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all dependencies to run that Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
