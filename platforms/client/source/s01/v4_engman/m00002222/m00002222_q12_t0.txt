message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date. We only consider line items that are actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the l_receiptdate should exceeds the l_commitdate, the ship mode should be in 'mail' or 'ship'. Also, only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The output results are grouped and ordered by l_shipmode in ascending order. For each group, we also count the number of lineitems of high order priority (those with priority URGENT or HIGH), and the number of lineitems of low order priority  (with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, **1. Python code (query.py):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Establish connection to Redis
redis_host = 'redis'
redis_port = 6379
redis_db = 0
redis_client = DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)

# Retrieve data from Redis
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'), orient='index')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'), orient='index')

# Merge DataFrames on their keys
merged_df = pd.merge(
    orders_df,
    lineitem_df,
    left_on='O_ORDERKEY',
    right_on='L_ORDERKEY',
    how='inner'
)

# Perform the analysis
high_priority_modes = ['MAIL', 'SHIP']
filtered_df = merged_df[
    (merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(high_priority_modes)) &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] <= '1995-01-01') &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']) &
    (merged_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'])
]

# Classify order priority
filtered_df['PRIORITY_GROUP'] = filtered_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].apply(
    lambda x: 'HIGH' if x in ['URGENT', 'HIGH'] else 'LOW'
)

# Group and aggregate data
result = filtered_df.groupby('L_SHIPMODE')['PRIORITY_GROUP'].value_counts().unstack(fill_value=0)
result.reset_index(inplace=True)
result.sort_values(by='L_SHIPMODE', ascending=True, inplace=True)

# Write output to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

**2. Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update
# Install Python3 and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
# Install Redis
sudo apt-get install -y redis-server
# Enable and start the Redis service
sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service
sudo systemctl start redis-server.service
# Install Python Redis client - Assuming direct_redis is a placeholder for actual client package
pip3 install redis pandas
# Replace 'direct_redis' package with a real package if needed
```

Please replace `'direct_redis'` with the actual Python package name for the Redis client that supports the `DirectRedis` class or override functionality as needed if `'direct_redis'` is not the actual package and it was used as a placeholder. If `'direct_redis'` is a proprietary or non-standard library that doesn't exist in the Python Package Index (PyPI), you would need to install it manually or provide the package/source to ensure the code runs properly.
