This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Establish a connection to the Redis database
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read DataFrames from Redis using the DirectRedis connection
customers_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('customer'), orient='records')
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('orders'), orient='records')

# Convert C_PHONE to country code by taking the first two characters
customers_df['CNTRYCODE'] = customers_df['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2)

# Filter country codes according to the requirement
filtered_customers_df = customers_df[customers_df['CNTRYCODE'].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])]

# Convert O_ORDERDATE to datetime

# Get the average account balance of people with an account balance greater than 0.00 for each country code
avg_acct_balance_per_country = customers_positive_balance.groupby('CNTRYCODE')['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().reset_index(name='AVG_ACCTBAL')

# Merge customers with average account balance per country to filter customers with account balance greater than the average
result = pd.merge(customers_positive_balance, avg_acct_balance_per_country, on='CNTRYCODE')
result_filtered = result[result['C_ACCTBAL'] > result['AVG_ACCTBAL']]

# Group by CNTRYCODE and count the number of such customers and sum of their account balances
final_result = result_filtered.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg(
    NUM_CUSTOMERS=pd.NamedAgg(column='C_CUSTKEY', aggfunc='count'),
    TOTAL_ACCTBAL=pd.NamedAgg(column='C_ACCTBAL', aggfunc='sum'),

2. Bash script (`setup.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt update

# Install pip for Python 3 if not already installed
sudo apt install -y python3-pip

# Install pandas package using pip
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis package (assuming it's available through pip, otherwise use the proper installation method provided by its maintainers)
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Make sure you have the execute permission on the `setup.sh` script by running:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Then you can run it using:
```bash
./setup.sh
```
Remember to provide the correct installation command for `direct_redis` if it is not a publicly available package or not installable via `pip`.
