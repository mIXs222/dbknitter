message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: customer, orders\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- customer: C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME, C_ADDRESS, C_NATIONKEY, C_PHONE, C_ACCTBAL, C_MKTSEGMENT, C_COMMENT\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. The Python code (`query_code.py`):

```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def main():
    # Connect to Redis database
    redis_host = "redis"
    redis_port = 6379
    redis_db = 0

    redis_client = DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)
    
    # Retrieve data from Redis tables as Pandas DataFrames
    customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('customer'))
    orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'))
    
    # Filter orders that are not pending or do not fall into deposits
    special_orders_df = orders_df[~orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', regex=True)]
    
    # Merge customers and special orders on customer key
    merged_df = pd.merge(customer_df, special_orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left')

    orders_per_customer = merged_df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY').size().reset_index(name='orders_count')
    
    # Group by the number of orders to get the distribution of customers
    customer_distribution = orders_per_customer.groupby('orders_count').size().reset_index(name='num_customers')

    customer_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

```bash

set -e

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pandas redis direct-redis
