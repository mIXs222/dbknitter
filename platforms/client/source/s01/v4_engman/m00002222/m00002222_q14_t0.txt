The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to execute the required query across different databases:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Retrieve data from MySQL 'part' table where 'P_NAME' indicates a promotional part
promotion_parts_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY
FROM part
WHERE P_NAME like '%Promo%'
"""
mysql_cursor.execute(promotion_parts_query)
promotion_parts = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
promotion_part_keys = [row[0] for row in promotion_parts]

mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()

# Establish connection to Redis
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve data from Redis 'lineitem' table
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'), orient='records')

# Filter for line items corresponding to the promotion parts and within the date range
promotion_lineitems = lineitem_df[
    lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(promotion_part_keys) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1995-09-01') &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1995-10-01')
]

# Calculate revenue
promotion_lineitems['revenue'] = promotion_lineitems['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - promotion_lineitems['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Calculate total revenue for the promotion period
total_promotion_revenue = promotion_lineitems['revenue'].sum()

# Write the result to query_output.csv
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write('total_promotion_revenue\n')
    outfile.write(f'{total_promotion_revenue}\n')
```

Here is the Bash script to install all the dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql pandas redis direct_redis
```

Please make sure that this bash script has the execute permission before running it. You can set the execute permission by using `chmod +x script_name.sh`. Also, ensure `pip` is installed and available in your environment.
