In case of a tie, the query lists all suppliers whose contribution was equal to the maximum, presented in supplier number order. Overall revenue is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)). The output columns should include S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_PHONE, and TOTAL_REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query across the two different databases and output the result to a CSV file:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Function to get revenue from MySQL
def get_revenue(mysql_conn):
    cur = mysql_conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("""
    SELECT
        L_SUPPKEY, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
    FROM
        lineitem
    WHERE
        L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01' AND L_SHIPDATE < '1996-04-01'
    GROUP BY
        L_SUPPKEY
    """)
    revenue_data = cur.fetchall()
    cur.close()
    return revenue_data

# Function to get supplier details from MongoDB
def get_supplier_details(mongo_conn, supplier_keys):
    supplier_details = {}
    for supp_key in supplier_keys:
        supplier_detail = mongo_conn.tpch.supplier.find_one({'S_SUPPKEY': supp_key})
        supplier_details[supp_key] = supplier_detail
    return supplier_details

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_conn = mongo_client.tpch

# Get revenues and supplier keys from MySQL
revenues = get_revenue(mysql_conn)

# Find the maximum revenue
max_revenue = max([rev['TOTAL_REVENUE'] for rev in revenues])

# Get the supplier keys with the maximum revenue
max_supplier_keys = [rev['L_SUPPKEY'] for rev in revenues if rev['TOTAL_REVENUE'] == max_revenue]

# Get supplier details from MongoDB
suppliers_info = get_supplier_details(mongo_conn, max_supplier_keys)

# Write the result to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE', 'TOTAL_REVENUE'])
    # Write each supplier's detail and revenue
    for supp_key in sorted(max_supplier_keys):
        supplier = suppliers_info[supp_key]
        if supplier:
            writer.writerow([
                supplier['S_SUPPKEY'],
                supplier['S_NAME'],
                supplier['S_ADDRESS'],
                supplier['S_PHONE'],
                max_revenue
            ])

# Close the connections
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
# install.sh
#!/bin/bash

pip install pymysql
pip install pymongo
```

To make the bash script executable, you would change its permissions using `chmod +x install.sh`, and then you can run it with `./install.sh`. After the dependencies are installed, you can execute the Python script with `python query.py`.
