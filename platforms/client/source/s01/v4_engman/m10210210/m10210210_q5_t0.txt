The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in ASIA. The query considers only parts ordered between 1990-01-01 and 1995-01-01. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)). Please output the columns in the order of N_NAME and REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
