This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code in a `.py` file format:

```python
# query_executer.py
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongo_db['orders']

# Connect to Redis
redis = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve 'orders' collection from MongoDB and filter out pending and deposits
mongo_orders_query = {
    "$and": [
        {"O_COMMENT": {"$not": {"$regex": ".*pending.*deposits.*"}}},
        {"O_ORDERSTATUS": {"$ne": "O"}}
    ]
}
projection_fields = {
    "_id": 0, "O_CUSTKEY": 1
}
orders_data = list(orders_collection.find(mongo_orders_query, projection_fields))
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data)

# Retrieve 'customer' table from Redis and load into Pandas DataFrame
customer_data = redis.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_json(customer_data)

# Merge the two datasets on C_CUSTKEY and O_CUSTKEY
merged_df = pd.merge(orders_df, customer_df, how='inner',
                     left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')

# Create the output dataframe with counts of orders per customer
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'num_orders': merged_df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY').size()})
output_df = output_df['num_orders'].value_counts().reset_index()
output_df.columns = ['num_orders', 'num_customers']

# Write the results to 'query_output.csv'
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next is the requested bash script as a `.sh` file to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pymongo, pandas, and direct_redis
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct_redis
