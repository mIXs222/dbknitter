Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person. The result only has one column, which is SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the given query:

```python
# revenue_query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', passwd='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_query = """
SELECT SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
FROM lineitem
WHERE (
            (L_SHIPMODE = 'AIR' OR L_SHIPMODE = 'AIR REG') AND
            L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
      )
"""

# Execute query and fetch results
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(mysql_query)
    result = cursor.fetchone()

# Convert MySQL result to dataframe
df_mysql = pd.DataFrame([result], columns=['REVENUE'])

# Redis connection
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(port=6379, host='redis')
part_keys = ['part:12:container', 'part:23:container', 'part:34:container']

# Fetch Redis data frames
redis_data_frames = []
for key in part_keys:
    # Fetching dataframe from Redis
    ser = redis_conn.get(key)  # Assuming the key structure should be determined
    if ser:
        df_redis = pd.read_msgpack(ser)
        redis_data_frames.append(df_redis)
        
# Combining Redis data frames
df_redis_combined = pd.concat(redis_data_frames, ignore_index=True) if redis_data_frames else pd.DataFrame()

# Merging MySQL and Redis data frames based on part keys
df_merged = pd.merge(df_mysql, df_redis_combined, how='inner', left_on=['L_PARTKEY'], right_on=['P_PARTKEY'])

# Perform calculation on merged dataframe
df_merged['REVENUE'] = df_merged.apply(lambda row: row['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - row['L_DISCOUNT']), axis=1)

# Sum and output
total_revenue = df_merged['REVENUE'].sum()
final_output = pd.DataFrame({'REVENUE': [total_revenue]})
final_output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()
```

And here is the Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3, pip and Redis if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip redis-server

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis
```

Please note that the code may need to be modified based on the specific structure and data encoding used in Redis, such as how the data is serialized and the exact keys under which the part data is stored. The assumption is that part data is retrievable using a key pattern like 'part:12:container', which might not be the case, and the `get` method might not return a Pandas DataFrame directly. If so, you would need to adjust the Redis part of the code to match your exact Redis schema and serialization format.
