Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person. The result only has one column, which is SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code (`query_executor.py`) to fulfill the requirements:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Query MySQL for parts information
with conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part
    WHERE
        (P_BRAND = 'Brand#12' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
     OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
     OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#34' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15)
    """)
    qualifying_parts = cursor.fetchall()

# Process qualifying parts to filter lineitem records from MongoDB
qualifying_part_keys = [part[0] for part in qualifying_parts]

# Define function to qualify lineitem document
def qualifies(doc):
    return (
        doc['L_PARTKEY'] in qualifying_part_keys
        and doc['L_SHIPMODE'] in ['AIR', 'AIR REG']
        and doc['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
        and (
            (doc['L_QUANTITY'] >= 1 and doc['L_QUANTITY'] <= 11 and doc['L_PARTKEY'] in qualifying_part_keys)
            or (doc['L_QUANTITY'] >= 10 and doc['L_QUANTITY'] <= 20 and doc['L_PARTKEY'] in qualifying_part_keys)
            or (doc['L_QUANTITY'] >= 20 and doc['L_QUANTITY'] <= 30 and doc['L_PARTKEY'] in qualifying_part_keys)
        )
    )

# Apply the filter to the lineitem collection to compute the revenue
revenue = 0.0
lineitem_collection = mongo_db['lineitem']
for doc in lineitem_collection.find():
    if qualifies(doc):
        revenue += doc['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - doc['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Write the result to a file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csv_writer.writerow(['REVENUE'])
    csv_writer.writerow([revenue])

# Close the connections
conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all Python dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install Python pip if not already installed
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the necessary Python libraries for the project
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
