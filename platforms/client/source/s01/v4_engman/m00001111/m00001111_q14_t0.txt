The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to execute the given business logic across the different databases:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pymongo
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password="my-secret-pw",
    database="tpch"
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_lineitem = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# Filter dates for MongoDB query
start_date = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
end_date = datetime(1995, 10, 1)

# Retrieve data from MongoDB
mongo_query = {
    "L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte": start_date, "$lt": end_date}
}
lineitems = list(mongo_lineitem.find(mongo_query, {"_id": 0, "L_PARTKEY": 1, "L_EXTENDEDPRICE": 1, "L_DISCOUNT": 1}))

# Create a dictionary of partkeys to calculate revenue
part_revenue = {}

    price = item["L_EXTENDEDPRICE"]
    discount = item["L_DISCOUNT"]

    if partkey in part_revenue:
        part_revenue[partkey] += revenue
    else:
        part_revenue[partkey] = revenue

# Save the output to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:

# Close connections
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_conn.close()
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the associated Bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python3 and PIP if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
