The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's key, name, revenue lost, account balance, nation, address, phone number and comment information. The results are listed in ascending order of revenue lost, customer key, and customer name and descending order of customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code you requested (save this as `query_execution.py`):

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
)

# Query MySQL data
with mysql_connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT 
        c.C_CUSTKEY,
        c.C_NAME,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue_lost,
        c.C_ACCTBAL,
        c.C_ADDRESS,
        c.C_PHONE,
        c.C_COMMENT
    FROM
        customer c
    JOIN orders o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY 
    JOIN lineitem l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY 
    WHERE 
        l.L_RETURNFLAG = 'R' 
        AND o.O_ORDERDATE >= '1993-10-01' 
        AND o.O_ORDERDATE < '1994-01-01'
    GROUP BY 
        c.C_CUSTKEY, c.C_NAME, c.C_ACCTBAL, c.C_ADDRESS, c.C_PHONE, c.C_COMMENT
    ORDER BY 
        revenue_lost ASC, c.C_CUSTKEY ASC, c.C_NAME ASC, c.C_ACCTBAL DESC;
    """)
    mysql_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Prepare the DataFrame
mysql_df = pd.DataFrame(mysql_data, columns=["C_CUSTKEY", "C_NAME", "revenue_lost", "C_ACCTBAL", "C_ADDRESS", "C_PHONE", "C_COMMENT"])

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Query Redis data
nation_data = redis_connection.get('nation')
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(eval(nation_data), columns=["N_NATIONKEY", "N_NAME", "N_REGIONKEY", "N_COMMENT"])

# Merge MySQL and Redis data
result_df = pd.merge(mysql_df, nation_df, how='left', left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Write to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here's the bash script to install the dependencies (save this as `setup_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pymysql pandas
pip install git+https://github.com/tanoabeleyra/direct_redis.git
```

Make sure to mark the bash script as executable by running `chmod +x setup_dependencies.sh` before executing it.
