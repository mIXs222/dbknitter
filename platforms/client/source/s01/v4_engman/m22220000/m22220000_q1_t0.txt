message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nmysql has database named tpch with tables: lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in mysql:\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with mysql, use these connection information:\n- database name: tpch\n- username: root\n- password: my-secret-pw\n- hostname: mysql\n- instruction: Use the python library 'pymysql' to connect the mysql server. Do NOT use 'pymysql.cursors.DictCursor'.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped before 1998-09-02. The query lists totals for quantity, extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

finally:

And below is the requested Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all the necessary dependencies to run the Python code:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if the script is run as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
  then echo "Please run as root or use sudo"
  exit
fi

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python if it is not available
command -v python3 > /dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "Python is not installed. Installing Python..."
    apt-get install -y python3
}

# Install pip if it is not available
command -v pip3 > /dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "Pip is not installed. Installing Pip..."
    apt-get install -y python3-pip
}

# Install PyMySQL using pip
pip3 install pymysql
