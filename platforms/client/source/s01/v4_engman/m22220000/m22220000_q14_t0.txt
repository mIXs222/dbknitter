The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to the MySQL database
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Query to select lineitems within the date range
lineitem_query = """
SELECT L_ORDERKEY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT
FROM lineitem
WHERE L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01' AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01'
"""
lineitem_df = pd.read_sql(lineitem_query, mysql_conn)

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to the Redis database
redis = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve 'part' table data from Redis as Pandas DataFrame
part_df = pd.read_json(redis.get('part'), orient='records')

# Data Preprocessing
lineitem_df['REVENUE'] = lineitem_df.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - lineitem_df.L_DISCOUNT)

# Merge the dataframes on PARTKEY
merged_df = lineitem_df.merge(part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# The user assumes that parts considered "promotional" can be identified by a flag
# or attribute, and stored in SQL DBMS. This needs to be checked if there is
# such a column in the database. Here we assume P_COMMENT includes 'Promotion'
# keyword for promotional parts.

# Filter promotional parts from merged dataframes
promotional_df = merged_df[merged_df.P_COMMENT.str.contains("Promotion", na=False)]

# Calculate the total revenue and total promotional revenue
total_revenue = lineitem_df['REVENUE'].sum()
promotional_revenue = promotional_df['REVENUE'].sum()

# Calculate the percentage
percentage_promotional_revenue = (promotional_revenue / total_revenue) * 100

# Output to CSV
result_df = pd.DataFrame({'Percentage': [percentage_promotional_revenue]})
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
