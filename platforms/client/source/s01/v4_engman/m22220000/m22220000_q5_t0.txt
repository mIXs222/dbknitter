The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in ASIA. The query considers only parts ordered between 1990-01-01 and 1995-01-01. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)). Please output the columns in the order of N_NAME and REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code (query_exec.py):

```python
import pymysql
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# MySQL connection and query
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_query = """
SELECT c.C_CUSTKEY, sum(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) as REVENUE
FROM customer c
JOIN orders o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
JOIN lineitem l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
WHERE o.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1995-01-01'
GROUP BY c.C_CUSTKEY;
"""

mysql_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Redis connection and data retrieval
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
nation_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('nation'))
region_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('region'))
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_conn.get('supplier'))

# Merge and filter data
asia_region = region_df[region_df['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA']['R_REGIONKEY'].iloc[0]
asia_nations = nation_df[nation_df['N_REGIONKEY'] == asia_region]

# Identify customers and suppliers in Asia
asia_customers = mysql_df[mysql_df['C_NATIONKEY'].isin(asia_nations['N_NATIONKEY'])]
asia_suppliers = supplier_df[supplier_df['S_NATIONKEY'].isin(asia_nations['N_NATIONKEY'])]

# Merge to get the final DataFrame
final_df = pd.merge(asia_customers, asia_suppliers, left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='S_NATIONKEY')
final_df = final_df.groupby(['N_NAME'])['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()
final_df.sort_values(by='REVENUE', inplace=True, ascending=False)

# Write the result to a CSV file
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script (install_dependencies.sh) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pandas
```
Please note that you may need to add installation instructions for `direct_redis` if it is a custom or third-party library not available in standard repositories, and also, the code given may require adaptations for `direct_redis` as no standard API was given for extracting Redis data as Pandas DataFrame. Additionally, make sure to grant executable permissions to the bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`.
