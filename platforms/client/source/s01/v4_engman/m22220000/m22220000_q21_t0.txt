Multi-Supplier order means the same order has multiple lineitems that has different suppliers. Please output NUMWAIT and S_NAME columne in the order of number of await lineitems in descending order and S_NAME ascending.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Below is the Python code required to execute the query on different data platforms and combine the results:

```python
# suppliers_who_kept_orders_waiting.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             db='tpch')

# Query orders and lineitem from MySQL
query = """
SELECT l1.L_SUPPKEY, COUNT(*) AS NUMWAIT
FROM lineitem l1
JOIN orders o ON l1.L_ORDERKEY = o.O_ORDERKEY
WHERE o.O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'
AND l1.L_COMMITDATE < l1.L_RECEIPTDATE
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM lineitem l2
    WHERE l1.L_ORDERKEY = l2.L_ORDERKEY
    AND l1.L_SUPPKEY != l2.L_SUPPKEY
)
GROUP BY l1.L_SUPPKEY
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
ORDER BY NUMWAIT DESC, l1.L_SUPPKEY ASC;
"""
with mysql_conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(query)
    suppliers_result = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert result to DataFrame
suppliers_df = pd.DataFrame(suppliers_result, columns=['S_SUPPKEY', 'NUMWAIT'])

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch nation and supplier data from Redis and convert to DataFrame
nation = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('nation'), orient='records')
supplier = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('supplier'), orient='records')

# Close connections
mysql_conn.close()

# Filter for nation SAUDI ARABIA
saudi_nation_key = nation[nation['N_NAME'] == 'SAUDI ARABIA']['N_NATIONKEY'].iloc[0]

# Filter suppliers in SAUDI ARABIA
saudi_suppliers = supplier[supplier['S_NATIONKEY'] == saudi_nation_key]

# Merge results to get supplier names
final_result = suppliers_df.merge(saudi_suppliers, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Select required columns and sort
final_result = final_result[['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME']].sort_values(by=['NUMWAIT', 'S_NAME'], ascending=[False, True])

# Output to CSV
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And the Bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pymysql for MySQL
pip install pymysql

# Install direct_redis for Redis, assuming it's a Python package
pip install direct_redis

# Install pandas for data manipulation
pip install pandas
```

Please make sure to give executable permissions to the bash script file using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it. Also, take note that the `direct_redis.DirectRedis` is a hypothetical Python package and may not be available. The actual package to use for Redis in Python would typically be just `redis`. Adjust the script accordingly if this instruction was intended to refer to the standard Redis client for Python.
