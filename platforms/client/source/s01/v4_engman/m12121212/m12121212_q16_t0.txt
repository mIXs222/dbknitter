It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the mentioned query across MongoDB and Redis:

```python
# query.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# MongoDB Connection Setup
mongo_client = MongoClient("mongodb", 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Retrieve MongoDB Documents
part_col = mongo_db['part']
partsupp_col = mongo_db['partsupp']

# Query for the desired parts excluding brand id of 45
part_query = {
    'P_SIZE': {'$in': [49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]},
    'P_TYPE': {'$ne': 'MEDIUM POLISHED'},
    'P_BRAND': {'$ne': 'Brand#45'}
}

# Convert MongoDB documents to Pandas DataFrame
part_df = pd.DataFrame(list(part_col.find(part_query, {'_id': 0})))
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(partsupp_col.find({}, {'_id': 0})))

# Redis Connection Setup
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Retrieve Redis Data for supplier
supplier_df = pd.read_msgpack(r.get('supplier'))

# Filter out suppliers with complaints
filtered_supplier_df = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Merge Tables on part key
joined_df = partsupp_df.merge(part_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# Merge with supplier data
final_df = joined_df.merge(filtered_supplier_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Count distinct suppliers
result_df = final_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).agg({'S_SUPPKEY': 'nunique'}).reset_index()

# Rename columns for final output
result_df.rename(columns={'S_SUPPKEY': 'SUPPLIER_COUNT'}, inplace=True)

# Sort as specified by the query description
result_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_COUNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True], inplace=True)

# Save to CSV
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Next, here is the Bash script to install all dependencies needed to run that Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip for Python package management
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MongoDB Python Client - pymongo
pip3 install pymongo

# Install direct_redis
pip3 install git+https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/direct_redis.git

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

Make sure to give the Bash script execution permissions and then you can run it to install the necessary dependencies before executing the Python script.
