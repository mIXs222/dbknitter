This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query (query.py):

```python
import pymongo
import redis
import pandas as pd
from itertools import groupby

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']
mongodb_orders_col = db['orders']

# Connect to Redis
r = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)

# Get orders data from MongoDB
orders_data = list(mongodb_orders_col.find({}, {'_id': 0, 'O_CUSTKEY': 1, 'O_COMMENT': 1}))

# Get customer data keys from Redis
customer_keys = r.keys('customer:*')

# Get customer data from Redis
customers_data = []
for key in customer_keys:
    customers_data.append(r.hgetall(key))

# Convert Redis data to DataFrame
customers_df = pd.DataFrame(customers_data)

# Convert MongoDB data to DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data)

# Filter out the orders with 'pending' and 'deposits' in the comment
filtered_orders_df = orders_df[~orders_df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', regex=True)]

# Group by 'O_CUSTKEY' and count the number of orders per customer
orders_count_per_customer = filtered_orders_df.groupby('O_CUSTKEY').size().reset_index(name='order_count')

# Count the number of customers per order count
distribution = orders_count_per_customer.groupby('order_count').size().reset_index(name='customer_count')

# Renaming columns to match the query output
distribution = distribution.rename(columns={'order_count': 'number_of_orders', 'customer_count': 'number_of_customers'})

# Write result to CSV
distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the Bash script to install all dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and Pip if they are not installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the pymongo library
pip3 install pymongo

# Install the redis library
pip3 install redis

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

Make both files executable and then you can run the Bash script to install dependencies using `./install_dependencies.sh`, followed by executing the Python code using `python3 query.py`.
