This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. The Python code (`query_script.py`):

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connect to the MongoDB instance
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongo_db['orders']

# Get current date and go back 7 years
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)

# Convert the collection to Pandas DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_collection.find(
    {
        "O_ORDERDATE": {"$lt": seven_years_ago},
        "O_TOTALPRICE": {"$gt": 0.0}
    },
    {
        "_id": False,
        "O_CUSTKEY": True
    }
)))

# Orders made by customers in the last 7 years will be excluded
excluded_customers = set(orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'])

# Connect to the Redis instance
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get 'customer' table from Redis as a DataFrame
customer_json = redis_client.get('customer')
customer_df = pd.read_json(customer_json, orient='records')

# Process the dataframe
filtered_customer_df = customer_df[
    (~customer_df['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(excluded_customers)) & 
    (customer_df['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2).isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])) &
    (customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.0)
]

# Compute the average account balance
average_acct_balance = filtered_customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'].mean()

# Filter customers with account balance greater than the average
target_customers_df = filtered_customer_df[filtered_customer_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > average_acct_balance]

# Select country code and calculate aggregated values
result_df = target_customers_df.groupby(target_customers_df['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2)).agg(
    num_customers=pd.NamedAgg(column="C_CUSTKEY", aggfunc="count"),
    total_acct_balance=pd.NamedAgg(column="C_ACCTBAL", aggfunc="sum")
).reset_index()

result_df.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'NUM_CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL_ACCT_BALANCE']

# Sort the results
result_df.sort_values(by='CNTRYCODE', inplace=True)

# Write the results to query_output.csv
result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. The Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install pip if it's not installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo
pip3 install direct-redis
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install numpy

# The direct_redis package may not exist on PyPI, this is a fictitious package based on the given question.
# For Redis with Python normally `redis-py` is used, hence `redis` package should be installed but as per problem statement, we are considering 'direct_redis'.

# To ensure that the script can be called with or without ./ (e.g., bash install_dependencies.sh)
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Please note that `direct_redis.DirectRedis` is not a standard package available on PyPI. The Python code provided is based on the assumption that such a package is available and provides a method called `get` which returns a JSON string that can be converted into a Pandas DataFrame. If this is not the case, the code will need to be adjusted to the actual method of querying data from Redis.
