response, Here is the Python code to execute the query on the original data from different data platforms:

```python
# import needed libraries
import pymongo
import direct_redis
import pandas as pd

# Connect to mongodb
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
part_collection = mongo_db["part"]

# Query mongodb for BRAND#23 with MED BAG parts
part_query = {"P_BRAND": "BRAND#23", "P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG"}
part_projection = {"P_PARTKEY": 1, "_id": 0}
part_keys = set(doc['P_PARTKEY'] for doc in part_collection.find(part_query, part_projection))

# Connect to redis
redis_client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host="redis", port=6379, db=0)
lineitem_df = redis_client.get('lineitem')

# Filter lineitem DataFrame to include only relevant part keys
lineitem_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df["L_PARTKEY"].isin(part_keys)]

# Determine the average quantity and filter lineitems with quantity < 20% of average
average_quantity = lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"].mean()
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"] < 0.2 * average_quantity]

# Calculate yearly loss in revenue - assuming 7 years database
filtered_lineitem_df["loss"] = filtered_lineitem_df["L_EXTENDEDPRICE"] * (1 - filtered_lineitem_df["L_DISCOUNT"])
total_loss = filtered_lineitem_df["loss"].sum()
average_yearly_loss = total_loss / 7

# Write result to CSV
output_df = pd.DataFrame([{'average_yearly_loss': average_yearly_loss}])
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Installing MongoDB driver
pip install pymongo

# Installing the direct_redis module
pip install git+https://github.com/panosc-eu/direct_redis.git

# Installing Pandas
pip install pandas
```
Please ensure you have the necessary permissions and environment set up to run these installation commands. Additionally, modify the scripts to accommodate any specific configuration or authentication requirements in your infrastructure.
