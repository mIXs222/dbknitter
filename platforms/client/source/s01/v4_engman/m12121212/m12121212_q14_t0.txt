The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to achieve the task described:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']
part_collection = mongo_db['part']

# Fetch promotional parts from MongoDB 'part' collection
mongo_query = {
    "$or": [
        {"P_NAME": {"$regex": ".*Promo.*", "$options": "i"}},
        {"P_COMMENT": {"$regex": ".*Promo.*", "$options": "i"}}
    ]
}
promotional_parts = list(part_collection.find(mongo_query, {"_id": 0, "P_PARTKEY": 1}))
promotional_part_keys = [item['P_PARTKEY'] for item in promotional_parts]

# Redis connection setup
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch 'lineitem' data from Redis and load it into a DataFrame
lineitem_str = r.get('lineitem')
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(lineitem_str)

# Filter lineitem data for the date range and promotional parts
date_start = datetime(1995, 9, 1)
date_end = datetime(1995, 10, 1)
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= date_start) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < date_end) &
    (lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(promotional_part_keys))
]

# Calculate the revenue
filtered_lineitem_df['REVENUE'] = (
    filtered_lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
)

# Calculate the total revenue and the promotional revenue
total_promo_revenue = filtered_lineitem_df['REVENUE'].sum()
total_revenue = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
total_revenue_sum = total_revenue.sum()

# Calculate the percentage of promotional revenue
promo_revenue_percentage = (total_promo_revenue / total_revenue_sum) * 100 if total_revenue_sum else 0

# Write the result to a CSV file
output = pd.DataFrame({
    'Total Revenue': [total_revenue_sum],
    'Promotional Revenue': [total_promo_revenue],
    'Percentage': [promo_revenue_percentage]
})
output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

The bash script to install the dependencies is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python and Pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymongo pandas redis direct_redis
