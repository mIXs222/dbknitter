Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person. The result only has one column, which is SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code you could use to execute the given query on the original data from MongoDB and Redis:

```python
# queries.py
import pymongo
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd

# MongoDB connection setup
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
mongo_collection = mongo_db["part"]

# Redis connection setup
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Brands, containers, and sizes conditions for the three types of parts
conditions = [
    {"P_BRAND": "Brand#12", "P_CONTAINER": {"$in": ["SM CASE", "SM BOX", "SM PACK", "SM PKG"]}, "P_SIZE": {"$gte": 1, "$lte": 5}},
    {"P_BRAND": "Brand#23", "P_CONTAINER": {"$in": ["MED BAG", "MED BOX", "MED PKG", "MED PACK"]}, "P_SIZE": {"$gte": 1, "$lte": 10}},
    {"P_BRAND": "Brand#34", "P_CONTAINER": {"$in": ["LG CASE", "LG BOX", "LG PACK", "LG PKG"]}, "P_SIZE": {"$gte": 1, "$lte": 15}}
]

part_keys = set()
for condition in conditions:
    for part_doc in mongo_collection.find(condition, {"_id": 0, "P_PARTKEY": 1}):
        part_keys.add(part_doc["P_PARTKEY"])

# Getting lineitem DataFrame
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get("lineitem"))

# Filtering data based on the given conditions
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[
    lineitem_df["L_PARTKEY"].isin(part_keys) &
    lineitem_df["L_SHIPMODE"].isin(["AIR", "AIR REG"]) &
    lineitem_df["L_SHIPINSTRUCT"].eq("DELIVER IN PERSON") &
    (
        (lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"] >= 1) & (lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"] <= 11) |
        (lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"] >= 10) & (lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"] <= 20) |
        (lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"] >= 20) & (lineitem_df["L_QUANTITY"] <= 30)
    )
]

# Calculating revenue
filtered_lineitem_df["REVENUE"] = filtered_lineitem_df["L_EXTENDEDPRICE"] * (1 - filtered_lineitem_df["L_DISCOUNT"])
revenue = filtered_lineitem_df["REVENUE"].sum()

# Writing result to CSV file
results_df = pd.DataFrame({"REVENUE": [revenue]})
results_df.to_csv("query_output.csv", index=False)
```

Now, here's the bash script to install all dependencies to run the Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt update

# Install Python 3 and Pip
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install MongoDB driver 'pymongo'
pip3 install pymongo

# Install Redis client 'direct_redis'
pip3 install direct_redis

# Install 'pandas'
pip3 install pandas
```

Make sure to give execution permissions to the bash script before running it:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
