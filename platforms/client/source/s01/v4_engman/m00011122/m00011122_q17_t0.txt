response, Below is the Python code to execute the given query across different data platforms and to write the output to `query_output.csv`.

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# MySQL connection
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# Query to get parts information from MySQL
part_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_BRAND, P_TYPE
FROM part
WHERE P_BRAND = 'BRAND#23' AND P_TYPE LIKE 'MED BAG%'
"""
part_df = pd.read_sql(part_query, mysql_connection)
mysql_connection.close()

# Redis connection
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Getting lineitem data from Redis
lineitem_df = pd.read_msgpack(redis_connection.get('lineitem'))

# Filter lineitem data for relevant parts using pandas
relevant_parts_keys = part_df['P_PARTKEY'].tolist()
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(relevant_parts_keys)]

# Compute the average quantity and further process
if not filtered_lineitem_df.empty:
    avg_quantity = filtered_lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'].mean()
    small_qty_threshold = avg_quantity * 0.2
    small_qty_df = filtered_lineitem_df[filtered_lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] < small_qty_threshold]

    # Determine the yearly loss
    small_qty_df['YEAR'] = pd.to_datetime(small_qty_df['L_SHIPDATE']).dt.year
    small_qty_df['LOSS'] = small_qty_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * small_qty_df['L_DISCOUNT']
    yearly_loss = small_qty_df.groupby('YEAR')['LOSS'].sum().mean()

    # Save output to csv
    yearly_loss_df = pd.DataFrame({'Average_Yearly_Loss': [yearly_loss]})
    yearly_loss_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```
Next is the bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies required to execute the above Python code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade
apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct_redis

# Note: If direct_redis has any additional dependencies or is not available via pip,
# the corresponding instructions to install it will be added here.
```

You will need to ensure that both the Python script and bash script have the appropriate permissions to be executed and that the bash script is run before the Python script.
