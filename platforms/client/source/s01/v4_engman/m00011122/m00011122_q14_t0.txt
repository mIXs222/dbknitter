The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue between 1995-09-01 and 1995-10-01 was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the requested Python code (query.py):

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# MySQL connection setup
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

# Query to select parts from the MySQL database
mysql_query = """
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_RETAILPRICE
FROM part
WHERE P_NAME LIKE '%Promo%'
"""

# Execute query on MySQL
mysql_parts = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Connection setup for Redis
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get data from Redis
redis_lineitem_df = redis_conn.get('lineitem')

# If the data returned is not a DataFrame, let's convert it to DataFrame
if not isinstance(redis_lineitem_df, pd.DataFrame):
    raise ValueError("Data from Redis is not a pandas DataFrame")

# Filter for the dates and calculate revenue
filtered_lineitem = redis_lineitem_df[(
    (redis_lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1995-09-01') &
    (redis_lineitem_df['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1995-10-01'))
]

# Merge the dataframes on partkey to associate parts with lineitems
merged_df = pd.merge(
    filtered_lineitem,
    mysql_parts,
    left_on='L_PARTKEY',
    right_on='P_PARTKEY',
    how='inner'
)

# Calculate the revenue for each lineitem
merged_df['revenue'] = merged_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - merged_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Aggregate the total revenue from promotional parts
total_revenue = merged_df['revenue'].sum()

# Output the results to a CSV file
merged_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Calculate percentage revenue from promotional parts
if total_revenue > 0:
    promo_revenue = merged_df.loc[merged_df['P_NAME'].str.contains('Promo'), 'revenue'].sum()
    promo_percent = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100
    with open('query_output.csv', 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"\nPromotional Revenue Percentage: {promo_percent:.2f}%")
else:
    with open('query_output.csv', 'a') as f:
        f.write("\nPromotional Revenue Percentage: No revenue in specified period.")
```

And here is the required Bash script to install all dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not installed
apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql to connect to MySQL
pip3 install pymysql

# Install direct_redis to connect to Redis
pip3 install direct-redis

# Install pandas (already required by direct_redis, just to make sure)
pip3 install pandas
```
