This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that executes the described query:

```python
# python_code.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
customer_collection = mongodb['customer']

# Filter and get the relevant customer data from MongoDB
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)
pipeline = [
    {"$project": {"C_CUSTKEY": 1, "C_PHONE": {"$substr": ["$C_PHONE", 0, 2]}, "C_ACCTBAL": 1}},
    {"$match": {"C_PHONE": {"$in": ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']}}},
    {"$group": {"_id": "$C_PHONE", "avg_acctbal": {"$avg": {"$cond": [{"$gt": ["$C_ACCTBAL", 0.00]}, "$C_ACCTBAL", None]}}}}
]
countries_customers = list(customer_collection.aggregate(pipeline))
average_balances = {_['id']: _['avg_acctbal'] for _ in countries_customers}

# Initiating connection to Redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Getting order data from Redis, assumes each order is a separate key in the Redis database
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(r.get('orders'))  # Use only if order data is stored in 'orders' key

# Process order data
orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'])
recent_orders = orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'][orders_df['O_ORDERDATE'] > seven_years_ago].unique()

# Exclude customers who placed recent orders and whose account balance is greater than 0
filtered_customers = [
    {
        "id": _["_id"],
        "num_customers": _["num_customers"],
        "total_balance": _["total_balance"]
    }
    for _ in countries_customers if _["_id"] not in recent_orders and _["avg_acctbal"] > 0
]

# Output the results to CSV
output_df = pd.DataFrame(filtered_customers, columns=['CNTRYCODE', 'num_customers', 'total_balance'])
output_df.sort_values('CNTRYCODE', ascending=True, inplace=True)
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# script.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Install MongoDB Driver
pip install pymongo

# Install Redis Data Access
pip install direct_redis

# Install pandas for DataFrame operations
pip install pandas
