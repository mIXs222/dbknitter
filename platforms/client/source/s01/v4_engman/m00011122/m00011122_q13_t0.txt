This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

```python
import pymongo
import redis
import pandas as pd

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
customer_collection = mongo_db["customer"]

# Get all customers from MongoDB
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_collection.find()))

# Redis Connection
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Load the orders data - Assuming the `DirectRedis` class works similarly to `StrictRedis`
order_str = redis_client.get('orders')
orders_data = pd.read_parquet(order_str, engine='pyarrow')

# Filter orders not containing 'pending' or 'deposits'
orders_filtered = orders_data[~orders_data['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', regex=True)]

# Count the orders per customer
order_count_per_customer = orders_filtered['O_CUSTKEY'].value_counts().reset_index()
order_count_per_customer.columns = ['C_CUSTKEY', 'order_count']

# Join with customer data to get number of orders per customer
customer_order_counts = pd.merge(customer_data, order_count_per_customer, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
customer_order_counts['order_count'] = customer_order_counts['order_count'].fillna(0).astype('int64')

# Calculate the distribution of customers by the number of orders
customer_distribution = customer_order_counts['order_count'].value_counts().reset_index()
customer_distribution.columns = ['number_of_orders', 'number_of_customers']

# Write the output to CSV
customer_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

2. Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade current packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install MongoDB, Redis and any other system dependencies (If required)
# sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
# sudo apt-get install -y redis-server

# If DirectRedis does not come from the standard redis-py package and it is a custom or third-party library,
# the following might be replaced with the actual installation steps.

# Install python dependencies
python3 -m pip install pymongo==3.12.3 # Using the version 3.12.3 as an example; Adjust as necessary
python3 -m pip install redis==4.1.0 # Using the version 4.1.0 as an example; Adjust as necessary
python3 -m pip install pandas==1.4.1 # Using the version 1.4.1 as an example; Adjust as necessary
python3 -m pip install pyarrow==6.0.1 # Using the version 6.0.1 as an example; Adjust as necessary
```

Please note that the DirectRedis class is not a standard redis class and seems to be a custom or third party class. The installation command for DirectRedis might need to be adjusted accordingly.
