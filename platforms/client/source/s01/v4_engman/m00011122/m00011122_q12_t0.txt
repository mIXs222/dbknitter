message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: orders, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- orders: O_ORDERKEY, O_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERSTATUS, O_TOTALPRICE, O_ORDERDATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY, O_CLERK, O_SHIPPRIORITY, O_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date. We only consider line items that are actually received by customers between 1994-01-01 and 1995-01-01 which is the receipt date, the l_receiptdate should exceeds the l_commitdate, the ship mode should be in 'mail' or 'ship'. Also, only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are considered. The output results are grouped and ordered by l_shipmode in ascending order. For each group, we also count the number of lineitems of high order priority (those with priority URGENT or HIGH), and the number of lineitems of low order priority  (with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, ### 1. The Python Code (query.py)

```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Connect to Redis
redis_host = "redis"
redis_port = 6379
redis_db = 0
redis_conn = DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)

# Retrieve data from Redis as pandas DataFrames
orders_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('orders'))
lineitem_df = pd.read_json(redis_conn.get('lineitem'))

# Merge the tables on the order key fields
merged_df = pd.merge(orders_df, lineitem_df, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Filter records based on the given conditions
filtered_df = merged_df[
    (merged_df['O_ORDERPRIORITY'].isin(['URGENT', 'HIGH'])) &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] < '1995-01-01') &
    (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] > merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']) &
    (merged_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']) &
    (merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP']))
]

# Group by ship mode and count line items of high order priority or not
results = filtered_df.groupby('L_SHIPMODE').agg(
    high_priority_count=pd.NamedAgg(column='O_ORDERPRIORITY', aggfunc=lambda x: (x == 'URGENT').sum()),
    low_priority_count=pd.NamedAgg(column='O_ORDERPRIORITY', aggfunc=lambda x: (x != 'URGENT').sum())
).reset_index()

# Write results to a CSV file
results.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

### 2. The Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install pandas
pip install pandas

# Install direct_redis (Assuming it's available on PyPI or replace it with the proper repository)
pip install direct_redis
```

Please make sure to give executable permissions to the bash script and execute it to install the dependencies before running the Python code.
