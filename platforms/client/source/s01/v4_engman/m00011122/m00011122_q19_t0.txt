Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes. The first type has a brand id of 12, a container of 'SM CASE', 'SM BOX' 'SM PACK', or 'SM PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 1 and less than or equal to 11, size between 1 and 5. The second type has a brand id of 23, a container of 'MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', or 'MED PACK', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 10 and less than or equal to 20, size between 1 and 10. The third type has a brand id of 34, a container of 'LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', or 'LG PKG', quantity which is greater than or eqaul to 20 and less than or equal to 30, size between 1 and 15. All should be shipped by air whose SHIPMODE is either 'AIR' or 'AIR REG' and delivered in person. The result only has one column, which is SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the multi-database query and output the results to a CSV file:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
)

# Prepare MySQL query
mysql_query = '''
SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part
WHERE (P_BRAND = 'Brand#12' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
   OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
   OR (P_BRAND = 'Brand#34' AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15)
'''

# Fetch MySQL data
mysql_df = pd.read_sql(mysql_query, mysql_conn)
mysql_conn.close()

# Redis connection
redis_conn = direct_redis.DirectRedis(
    host='redis',
    port=6379,
    db=0,
)

# Fetch Redis data
lineitem_df = redis_conn.get('lineitem')

# Filter Redis data
filtered_lineitem_df = lineitem_df[
    ((lineitem_df['L_SHIPMODE'] == 'AIR') | (lineitem_df['L_SHIPMODE'] == 'AIR REG')) &
    (lineitem_df['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON') &
    (((lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] >= 1) & (lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] <= 11)) |
     ((lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] >= 10) & (lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] <= 20)) |
     ((lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] >= 20) & (lineitem_df['L_QUANTITY'] <= 30)))
]

# Merge data frames to get the discounted revenue
discounted_revenue_df = filtered_lineitem_df[
    filtered_lineitem_df['L_PARTKEY'].isin(mysql_df['P_PARTKEY'])
]
discounted_revenue_df['REVENUE'] = discounted_revenue_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - discounted_revenue_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
result = pd.DataFrame([{'REVENUE': discounted_revenue_df['REVENUE'].sum()}])

# Write output to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is the Bash script to install all dependencies required to run the above Python code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_dependencies.sh

# Ensure pip is available
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip

# Install the pymysql library
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis or redis-py, assuming direct_redis is available via pip
# If it's not available via pip, this step would be different
pip3 install direct_redis
```

Make sure to give the Bash script executable permissions:

```sh
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

Before running the Python script, make sure to run the Bash script to install all required dependencies.
