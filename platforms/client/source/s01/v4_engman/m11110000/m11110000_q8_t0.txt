And here is the bash script to install the required dependencies (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update

# Upgrade the system
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pymysql and pymongo
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Please remember to give execute permission to the bash script before running it by using the command `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh`.
