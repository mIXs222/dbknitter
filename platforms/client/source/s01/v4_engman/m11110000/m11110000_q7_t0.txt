The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending). Please output the columns in the order of CUST_NATION, L_YEAR, REVENUE, SUPP_NATION\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2
