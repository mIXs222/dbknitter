If several suppliers in that EUROPE offers the BRASS part and size of 15 at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the suppliers with the order by account balance in descending order, and nation name, supplier name, part key in ascending order. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information. Please output the columns in the order of N_NAME, P_MFGR, P_PARTKEY, S_ACCTBAL, S_ADDRESS, S_COMMENT, S_NAME, S_PHONE.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the Python code you asked for (save it as `run_query.py`):

```python

mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')

mongodb_connection = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_connection['tpch']

# Find regionkey for EUROPE
region_key = None
for region in mongodb_db.region.find({"R_NAME": "EUROPE"}):
    region_key = region["R_REGIONKEY"]
    break

# Find nationkeys for nations in EUROPE
nation_keys = []
for nation in mongodb_db.nation.find({"N_REGIONKEY": region_key}):
    nation_keys.append(nation["N_NATIONKEY"])

# Query MongoDB for suppliers from the nations in EUROPE region and store them in a dictionary
suppliers_info = {}

    writer.writeheader()

# Close connections

```

And here's the bash script to install the dependencies (save it as `install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install python3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
```

Don't forget to make the bash script executable:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

To install the dependencies, run the bash script, and then run the Python code, execute these commands:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
python3 run_query.py
```
