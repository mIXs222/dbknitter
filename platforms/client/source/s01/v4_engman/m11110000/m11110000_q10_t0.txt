The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's key, name, revenue lost, account balance, nation, address, phone number and comment information. The results are listed in ascending order of revenue lost, customer key, and customer name and descending order of customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Here is the Bash script to install all the dependencies required to run the Python code:

```bash
# Bash script (setup.sh)

#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt-get update

# Install Python3 and pip if not already installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries
pip3 install pymysql pymongo
