The query considers only parts actually shipped and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# promotion_effect_query.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to the MongoDB server
mongo_client = MongoClient(host='mongodb', port=27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']

# Fetch 'lineitem' table data from MongoDB
lineitem_collection = mongodb['lineitem']
lineitem_cursor = lineitem_collection.find({
    'L_SHIPDATE': {
        '$gte': datetime(1995, 9, 1),
        '$lt': datetime(1995, 10, 1)
    }
})
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_cursor))

# Connect to Redis server
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch 'part' table data from Redis
part_df = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('part'), orient='records')

# Calculate Revenue from MongoDB lineitem data
lineitem_df['REVENUE'] = lineitem_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Join the data to find the promotional parts shipped
merged_df = pd.merge(
    lineitem_df,
    part_df,
    how='inner',
    left_on='L_PARTKEY',
    right_on='P_PARTKEY'
)

# Calculate and write the percentage revenue from promotional parts
total_revenue = lineitem_df['REVENUE'].sum()
promo_revenue = merged_df['REVENUE'].sum()
percent_promo_revenue = (promo_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 if total_revenue != 0 else 0

# Write output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['TOTAL_REVENUE', 'PROMO_REVENUE', 'PERCENT_PROMO_REVENUE']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerow({
        'TOTAL_REVENUE': total_revenue,
        'PROMO_REVENUE': promo_revenue,
        'PERCENT_PROMO_REVENUE': percent_promo_revenue
    })

# Close the MongoDB connection
mongo_client.close()
```

And here is the bash script to install all the dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update and install Python and pip
apt-get update -y
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python MongoDB client library
pip3 install pymongo

# Install Pandas
pip3 install pandas

# Install DirectRedis
pip3 install direct_redis
