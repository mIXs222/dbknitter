This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
# Create pandas DataFrame from orders using the connection
orders_sql = "SELECT O_CUSTKEY FROM orders WHERE YEAR(O_ORDERDATE) <= YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - 7"
orders_df = pd.read_sql(orders_sql, mysql_connection)
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
r = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379)
# Get customer data from redis and create a pandas DataFrame
customer_df = pd.read_json(r.get('customer'), orient='records')

# Filter customers from countries with specified codes
filtered_customers = customer_df[customer_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])]

# Filter customers with positive account balance
positive_bal_customers = filtered_customers[filtered_customers['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.00]
avg_bal_by_country = positive_bal_customers.groupby(positive_bal_customers['C_PHONE'].str[:2])['C_ACCTBAL'].mean().reset_index()
avg_bal_by_country.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'AVG_ACCTBAL']

# Find customers with balance greater than average and not in orders
filtered_customers = pd.merge(filtered_customers, orders_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left', indicator=True)
customers_without_orders = filtered_customers[filtered_customers['_merge'] == 'left_only']
eligible_customers = customers_without_orders.merge(avg_bal_by_country, left_on=customers_without_orders['C_PHONE'].str[:2], right_on='CNTRYCODE')
eligible_customers = eligible_customers[eligible_customers['C_ACCTBAL'] > eligible_customers['AVG_ACCTBAL']]

# Aggregating data by country code
result = eligible_customers.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg({'C_CUSTKEY': 'count', 'C_ACCTBAL': 'sum'}).reset_index()
result.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'NUM_CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL_ACCTBAL']
result = result.sort_values('CNTRYCODE')

# Save results to query_output.csv
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And the bash script to install all dependencies:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update packages and install Python and pip if they are not available
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymysql pandas direct-redis
