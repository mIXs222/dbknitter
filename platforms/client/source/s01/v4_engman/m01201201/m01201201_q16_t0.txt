The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code required to perform the operation:

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Establish connection to MySQL database tpch
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', 
                                   user='root', 
                                   password='my-secret-pw', 
                                   database='tpch')

# Query to select suppliers from MySQL
supplier_query = """
SELECT S_SUPPKEY
FROM supplier
WHERE S_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
"""

# Read the query results into a Pandas DataFrame
suppliers_df = pd.read_sql(supplier_query, mysql_connection)
mysql_connection.close()

# Establish a connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client.tpch

# Aggregate pipeline in MongoDB to filter and join the partsupp collection
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {
        "PS_PARTKEY": {"$nin": [45]},
        "PS_SUPPKEY": {"$nin": suppliers_df['S_SUPPKEY'].tolist()},
        "PS_COMMENT": {"$not": {"$regex": "MEDIUM POLISHED"}},
    }},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": {
            "PS_SUPPKEY": "$PS_SUPPKEY",
            "PS_AVAILQTY": "$PS_AVAILQTY",
            "PS_SUPPLYCOST": "$PS_SUPPLYCOST",
        },
        "count": {"$sum": 1}
    }},
    {"$sort": {"count": -1, "_id.PS_SUPPKEY": 1}}
]

# Execute the aggregate pipeline
partsupp_result = list(mongodb.partsupp.aggregate(pipeline))
mongo_client.close()

# Convert the results to a DataFrame
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame((d['_id'] for d in partsupp_result), columns=['PS_SUPPKEY', 'PS_AVAILQTY', 'PS_SUPPLYCOST'])
partsupp_df['count'] = pd.DataFrame([d['count'] for d in partsupp_result])

# Establish connection to Redis
redis_connection = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read part table from Redis into a Pandas DataFrame
part_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('part'))

# Filter parts with the specified sizes and not brand 45
part_df_filtered = part_df[
    part_df['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9]) &
    (part_df['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45')
]

# Merge the DataFrames (as if performing SQL joins) and final filtering
final_df = (
    partsupp_df.merge(suppliers_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
               .merge(part_df_filtered, how='inner', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
)

# Select the necessary columns for the final output
final_output = final_df[['PS_SUPPLYCOST', 'PS_AVAILQTY', 'count']].sort_values(
    by=['count', 'PS_SUPPLYCOST', 'PS_AVAILQTY'], ascending=[False, True, True]
)

# Write the output to a CSV file
final_output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And this is the Bash script to install the dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package list on the system
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip if it's not already available
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas direct-redis
```

Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to execute the Bash script or run it with `sudo` if necessary. Also, modify the `requirements.txt` file as needed for your specific Python environment. Additionally, you would need to install Redis and the Direct Redis Python library, which might have additional dependencies of their own.
