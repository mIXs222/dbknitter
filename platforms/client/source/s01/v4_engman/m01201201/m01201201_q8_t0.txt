response, Here is the Python code that will execute the given distributed query:

```python

import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Function to calculate the market share for given years.

    market_shares = []
    for year in years_data:
        filtered_data = years_data[year]
        # Filter for only small plated copper from suppliers in India

        market_shares.append((year, market_share))

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
supplier_sql = "SELECT S_SUPPKEY FROM supplier WHERE S_NATIONKEY IN (SELECT N_NATIONKEY FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'INDIA')"
suppliers = pd.read_sql(supplier_sql, mysql_conn)
india_suppliers = suppliers['S_SUPPKEY'].tolist()
mysql_conn.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
mongodb_client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb_db = mongodb_client['tpch']
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb_db['lineitem'].find()))

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(port=6379, db=0, host='redis')
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_client.get('customer'))  # Convert to DataFrame as needed

# Now let's filter the lineitem data for the years 1995 and 1996, product type SMALL PLATED COPPER
lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'])
years_data = {
    '1995': lineitem[(lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'].dt.year == 1995)],
    '1996': lineitem[(lineitem['L_SHIPDATE'].dt.year == 1996)]

Please save the above Python code as `execute_query.py`.

And the Bash script to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install pip and Python headers
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pymysql pymongo pandas

# Since direct_redis is a fictitious module for this example, we assume it is available somehow.
# Usually, it could be installed using a package manager like pip if it existed.
#pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please save the above Bash script as `install_dependencies.sh`. Remember to give it executable permissions using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.

As a reminder, some parts of the Python code might not execute properly, because `direct_redis.DirectRedis` is referenced as if it were real, but in reality, there is no such module available (to my knowledge as of the time of writing). If `direct_redis` does not exist, the Python code won't work, and it should be replaced with the actual way of retrieving data in a correct Redis-Pandas setup.
