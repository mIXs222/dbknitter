This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made. Thus, there are two column of output, one refers to the number of orders a customer have made, the other refers to the number of customers that made that number of order. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into pending or do not fall into deposits. Special categories are identified in the order comment column whose pattern is not like '%pending%deposits%'.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query described above by fetching and combining data from MongoDB and Redis:

```python
# Save this code in a file named `query_exec.py`

import pymongo
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# MongoDB connection and data retrieval
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]
orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Query for MongoDB to exclude orders with "pending" or "deposits" in the comment
orders_data = list(orders_collection.find(
    {
        "O_ORDERSTATUS": {"$nin": ["P", "D"]},
        "O_COMMENT": {"$not": {"$regex": ".*pending.*deposits.*"}}
    },
    {
        "_id": 0, "O_ORDERKEY": 1, "O_CUSTKEY": 1
    }
))

# Convert MongoDB orders data to DataFrame
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data)

# Redis connection and data retrieval
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read the 'customer' DataFrame stored in Redis
customer_df = pd.read_json(redis_connection.get('customer'), orient='records')

# Compute the number of orders per customer
orders_per_customer = orders_df.groupby('O_CUSTKEY').size().reset_index(name='number_of_orders')

# Compute the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made
customer_order_distribution = orders_per_customer.groupby('number_of_orders').size().reset_index(name='number_of_customers')

# Write the final dataframe to CSV
customer_order_distribution.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Now, here is the bash script to install the dependencies required to run the above Python script:

```bash
# Save this code in a file named `install_dependencies.sh`

#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install dependencies for query_exec.py

# Update package list and install pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pymongo pandas direct_redis
```

Remember to make the bash script executable:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
