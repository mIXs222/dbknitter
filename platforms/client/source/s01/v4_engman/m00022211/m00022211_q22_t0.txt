This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here's the python code (query.py) you can use to execute the described query:

```python
# query.py

from pymongo import MongoClient
from direct_redis import DirectRedis
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = mongo_client['tpch']
orders_collection = mongodb['orders']

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Fetch data from Redis
customers_data = redis_client.get('customer')
customers_df = pd.read_json(customers_data)

# Process customer data to filter country codes and account balances more than 0
filtered_customers = customers_df[
    customers_df['C_PHONE'].str[:2].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])
    & (customers_df['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0)
]

# Calculate the average account balance for the filtered customers
average_balance = filtered_customers['C_ACCTBAL'].mean()

# Get customers with account balance greater than average
target_customers = filtered_customers[filtered_customers['C_ACCTBAL'] > average_balance]

# Get orders from the last 7 years
seven_years_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7*365)
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_collection.find(
    {"O_ORDERDATE": {"$gte": seven_years_ago.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}}
)))

# Find customers who have not placed orders in the last 7 years
customers_not_ordered = target_customers[~target_customers['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(orders_df['O_CUSTKEY'])]

# Group by country codes
result = customers_not_ordered.groupby(customers_not_ordered['C_PHONE'].str[:2]) \
    .agg(number_of_customers=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'), total_account_balance=('C_ACCTBAL', 'sum')) \
    .reset_index().rename(columns={'C_PHONE': 'CNTRYCODE'})

# Sorting the result
result.sort_values(by='CNTRYCODE', inplace=True)

# Output to file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here is the bash script to install the dependencies (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install MongoDB driver pymongo
pip install pymongo

# Install direct_redis
pip install git+https://github.com/RedisJSON/direct_redis.git

# Install pandas
pip install pandas
```

Before running the bash script, ensure you have `pip` and `git` installed on your system.

To execute the bash script, you might need to give it executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the Python script with:

```bash
python query.py
```

Ensure that the environment where you are executing these scripts has access to the MongoDB and Redis instances with the specified hostnames and ports.
