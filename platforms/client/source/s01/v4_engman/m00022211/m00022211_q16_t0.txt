It might be used, for example, to determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts., The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements which does not have a brand id of 45. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes which are one of 49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, or 9, as long as they are not of MEDIUM POLISHED, not of a brand 45, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# query.py
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    db='tpch',
)

# Query parts from MySQL database
part_query = """SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_BRAND
                FROM part
                WHERE P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'
                AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
                AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9);"""
parts_df = pd.read_sql(part_query, mysql_connection)
mysql_connection.close()

# Connect to Redis
redis_connection = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Get supplier and partsupp tables from Redis
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_connection.get('supplier'))
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(redis_connection.get('partsupp'))

# Filter out suppliers with complaints
supplier_df = supplier_df[~supplier_df['S_COMMENT'].str.contains('Customer Complaints')]

# Join DataFrames to get the final output
result_df = parts_df.merge(partsupp_df, how='inner', left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')
result_df = result_df.merge(supplier_df, how='inner', left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')

# Count the number of suppliers that satisfy conditions
final_result_df = result_df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).agg({'S_SUPPKEY': 'count'}).reset_index()
final_result_df = final_result_df.rename(columns={'S_SUPPKEY': 'SUPPLIER_COUNT'})
final_result_df.sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_COUNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True], inplace=True)

# Write the output to CSV
final_result_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

And here is the Bash script to install the necessary dependencies to run that Python code:

```bash
# install_dependencies.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install pip and Python development files
apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install redis-py, which is the dependency for direct_redis
pip3 install redis

# Install direct_redis using the specific git repository (as it's not available on PyPI)
pip3 install git+https://github.com/patrys/direct_redis.git

# Install pymysql for MySQL connections
pip3 install pymysql

# Install pandas for handling data manipulation
pip3 install pandas
