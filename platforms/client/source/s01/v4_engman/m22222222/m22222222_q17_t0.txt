message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: part, lineitem\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- part: P_PARTKEY, P_NAME, P_MFGR, P_BRAND, P_TYPE, P_SIZE, P_CONTAINER, P_RETAILPRICE, P_COMMENT\n- lineitem: L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER, L_QUANTITY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT, L_TAX, L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_SHIPDATE, L_COMMITDATE, L_RECEIPTDATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT, L_SHIPMODE, L_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThe Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers only parts of BRAND#23 and with MED BAG and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken? The output should be the average yearly loss.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Python Code (`query.py`):

```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def calculate_loss():
    # Connect to Redis
    redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

    # Fetch data using the connection information provided
    part_table = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('part'))
    lineitem_table = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('lineitem'))

    # Filter parts of BRAND#23 and with MED BAG
    filtered_parts = part_table[(part_table['P_BRAND'] == 'BRAND#23') & (part_table['P_CONTAINER'] == 'MED BAG')]

    # Join the filtered parts with lineitem
    join_result = pd.merge(filtered_parts, lineitem_table, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')

    # Calculate average quantity of such parts ordered
    avg_quantity = join_result['L_QUANTITY'].mean()

    # Consider only the lineitems with quantity less than 20% of average quantity
    small_quantity_orders = join_result[join_result['L_QUANTITY'] < (0.20 * avg_quantity)]

    # Calculate the gross loss in revenue (undiscounted)
    gross_loss = small_quantity_orders['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'].sum()

    # Average yearly gross loss
    avg_yearly_gross_loss = gross_loss / 7 # as per the 7-year database

    # Save the result to a csv file
    pd.DataFrame({'avg_yearly_gross_loss': [avg_yearly_gross_loss]}).to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Execute the function
calculate_loss()
```

2. Bash Script (`install_dependencies.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python3 if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct-redis

# Note: Make sure that direct_redis is available as a package or adjust according to the real package name

```

Make sure to give execute permissions to the bash script after creating it by running:
```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
