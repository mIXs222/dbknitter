Multi-Supplier order means the same order has multiple lineitems that has different suppliers. Please output NUMWAIT and S_NAME columne in the order of number of await lineitems in descending order and S_NAME ascending.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

Part 2: Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run this script to install all dependencies for the Python code above.

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pandas and direct_redis through pip
pip3 install pandas redis

# Note: The direct_redis package is a hypothetical module as no public direct_redis package is available.
# If it were a real package, it would be installed using pip just like other packages.
# Please replace 'redis' with 'direct_redis' in the pip install command if the direct_redis is a real package.
```

Make sure to give the bash script execute permission using chmod +x install_dependencies.sh before running it.
