message_0,{'role': 'user', 'content': "I have several databases of different platforms.\n\nredis has database named 0 with tables: nation, supplier, partsupp\nRelevant table names and their schemas in redis:\n- nation: N_NATIONKEY, N_NAME, N_REGIONKEY, N_COMMENT\n- supplier: S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_NATIONKEY, S_PHONE, S_ACCTBAL, S_COMMENT\n- partsupp: PS_PARTKEY, PS_SUPPKEY, PS_AVAILQTY, PS_SUPPLYCOST, PS_COMMENT\nTo connect with redis, use these connection information:\n- database name: 0\n- port: 6379\n- hostname: redis\n- instruction: Use `direct_redis.DirectRedis` in place of `redis.Redis` to read Pandas DataFrame with `get('tablename')`.\n\n\nBut a user thought that all the tables are stored in a SQL DBMS, and wrote the following query: \n```english\nThis query finds the most important subset of suppliers' stock in GERMANY., The Important Stock Identification Query finds, from scanning the available stock of suppliers in GERMANY, all the parts that represent a significant percentage (larger then 0.0001) of the total value of all available parts. The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

    # Connect to the Redis database
    redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

2. Bash script (install_dependencies.sh):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script is used to install dependencies required by important_stock_query.py

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install pip for Python 3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install pandas library
sudo pip3 install pandas

# Install direct_redis, assuming it is a package that needs to be installed from a location like GitHub
# This is a placeholder since "direct_redis" isn't an actual known python package at the moment
# In a real-world scenario, one would replace the URL with the actual repository URL or PyPi package
# e.g. git+https://github.com/username/direct_redis.git or direct-redis
sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/path_to/direct_redis_repository.git

# If the package is already hosted on PyPi, uncomment the following line:
# sudo pip3 install direct_redis
