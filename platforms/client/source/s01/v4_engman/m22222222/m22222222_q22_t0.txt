This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years whose account balance is greater than the average account balance of people whose account balance is larger than 0.00 in those countries. It also reflects the magnitude of that balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone which should be one of '20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', or '21'. Please output the columns in the order of CNTRYCODE, number of such customers, and total account balance of those customers. It should be by in the order of CNTRYCODE ascending\n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the required Python code to execute the given query on your Redis data:

**Python Code (query_redis.py):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

# Create a connection to Redis
redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)

# Read the customer and orders tables into Pandas DataFrames
df_customer = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('customer'))
df_orders = pd.read_json(redis_client.get('orders'))

# Prepare the data according to the query conditions
# Extract the country code from the phone number
df_customer['CNTRYCODE'] = df_customer['C_PHONE'].str.slice(0, 2)
# Convert O_ORDERDATE to DateTime
df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'])
# Filter the customer DataFrame for customers from the specified country codes
country_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']
df_customer = df_customer[df_customer['CNTRYCODE'].isin(country_codes)]

# Calculate the average account balance for accounts greater than 0.00
avg_account_balance = df_customer[df_customer['C_ACCTBAL'] > 0.00]['C_ACCTBAL'].mean()

# Filter customers who have not placed orders for 7 years
seven_years_ago = pd.Timestamp.now() - pd.DateOffset(years=7)
df_customer_with_no_recent_orders = df_customer[~df_customer['C_CUSTKEY'].isin(df_orders[df_orders['O_ORDERDATE'] >= seven_years_ago]['O_CUSTKEY'])]

# Filter customers whose account balance is greater than the average account balance
df_filtered_customers = df_customer_with_no_recent_orders[df_customer_with_no_recent_orders['C_ACCTBAL'] > avg_account_balance]

# Group by country code and calculate the required statistics
result = df_filtered_customers.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg(
    num_customers=('C_CUSTKEY', 'count'),
    total_account_balance=('C_ACCTBAL', 'sum')
).reset_index()

# Sort the results by CNTRYCODE
result = result.sort_values('CNTRYCODE')

# Write the output to query_output.csv
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

```

**Bash Script (install_dependencies.sh):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install Python and pip if they aren't already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install direct_redis

```

Make sure to give execute permissions to the bash script using `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` before running it.
