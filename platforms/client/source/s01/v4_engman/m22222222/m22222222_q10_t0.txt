The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's key, name, revenue lost, account balance, nation, address, phone number and comment information. The results are listed in ascending order of revenue lost, customer key, and customer name and descending order of customer account balance. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems. \n```\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data (i.e. get the data from different data platforms and combine the results). Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, 1. Here is the Python code (`query_executor.py`):

```python
import pandas as pd
import direct_redis

# Connection details for Redis
redis_host = 'redis'
redis_port = 6379

# Connect to Redis using direct_redis
client = direct_redis.DirectRedis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port)

# Retrieve tables from Redis
nation = pd.DataFrame(eval(client.get('nation')))
customer = pd.DataFrame(eval(client.get('customer')))
orders = pd.DataFrame(eval(client.get('orders')))
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(eval(client.get('lineitem')))

# Filter the orders that are within the given date range
orders_filtered = orders[(orders['O_ORDERDATE'] >= '1993-10-01') & (orders['O_ORDERDATE'] < '1994-01-01')]

# Filter the lineitems for returned items
lineitem_returned = lineitem[lineitem['L_RETURNFLAG'] == 'R']

# Calculate revenue lost for lineitems
lineitem_returned['REVENUE_LOST'] = lineitem_returned['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem_returned['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Aggregate revenue lost of returns at the customer level
customer_revenue_lost = lineitem_returned \
    .groupby('L_ORDERKEY')['REVENUE_LOST'] \
    .sum() \
    .reset_index() \
    .merge(orders_filtered, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')

# Merge tables to get final result
final_result = customer_revenue_lost \
    .merge(customer, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY') \
    .merge(nation, left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

# Select required columns with correct order
final_result = final_result[[
    'C_CUSTKEY',
    'C_NAME',
    'REVENUE_LOST',
    'C_ACCTBAL',
    'N_NAME',
    'C_ADDRESS',
    'C_PHONE',
    'C_COMMENT'
]] \
    .sort_values(by=['REVENUE_LOST', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'C_NAME', 'C_ACCTBAL'], 
                 ascending=[True, True, True, False])

# Write output to csv
final_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

2. Here is the Bash script (`install_dependencies.sh`) to install all dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to install dependencies for the Python script

# Update package list and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Python3 and pip3 if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Install the required Python packages using pip
pip3 install pandas direct_redis
```

Please ensure you give executable permission to your bash script file by running `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` from the terminal before executing it.
