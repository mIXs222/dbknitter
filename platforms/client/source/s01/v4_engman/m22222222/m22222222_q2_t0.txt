If several suppliers in that EUROPE offers the BRASS part and size of 15 at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the suppliers with the order by account balance in descending order, and nation name, supplier name, part key in ascending order. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information.

Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

response, Here is the Python code that achieves the functionality you described. However, the integration and transformation of data from Redis might involve specific libraries and operations that are not part of standard Python packages; for the purpose of this code, I would assume the fictional `direct_redis` library exists, but in reality, you would use the `redis-py` or similar library to interact with Redis:

```python
# query.py
import pandas as pd
import csv
from direct_redis import DirectRedis

def get_data_from_redis(table_name):
    redis_client = DirectRedis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0)
    data = redis_client.get(table_name)
    df = pd.read_json(data)
    return df

# Loading the data from Redis
nation_df = get_data_from_redis('nation')
region_df = get_data_from_redis('region')
part_df = get_data_from_redis('part')
supplier_df = get_data_from_redis('supplier')
partsupp_df = get_data_from_redis('partsupp')

# Filtering and joining the data
europe_nations = region_df.query("R_NAME == 'EUROPE'") \
    .merge(nation_df, left_on='R_REGIONKEY', right_on='N_REGIONKEY')

brass_parts = part_df.query("P_TYPE == 'BRASS' and P_SIZE == 15")

qualified_parts = brass_parts.merge(partsupp_df, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY') \
    .merge(supplier_df, left_on='PS_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY') \
    .merge(europe_nations, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')

qualified_parts['MIN_PS_SUPPLYCOST'] = qualified_parts.groupby('P_PARTKEY')['PS_SUPPLYCOST'].transform('min')
min_cost_parts = qualified_parts.query("PS_SUPPLYCOST == MIN_PS_SUPPLYCOST")

# Sorting and selecting columns
result = min_cost_parts.sort_values(by=['S_ACCTBAL', 'N_NAME', 'S_NAME', 'P_PARTKEY'], ascending=[False, True, True, True]) \
    [['N_NAME', 'P_MFGR', 'P_PARTKEY', 'S_ACCTBAL', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_COMMENT', 'S_NAME', 'S_PHONE']]

# Saving the result to a CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
```

And here is the bash script to install Python and the necessary dependencies. Since there is no actual `direct_redis` Python library, for demonstration purposes, I'm including instructions for `redis-py`, which is a common Redis client for Python:

```bash
# setup.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update system package manager and install python3 and python3-pip if not installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install Redis clients for Python (redis-py)
# Note: direct_redis is fictional. In reality, use redis-py or other libraries.
pip3 install redis pandas

# Sample placeholder for direct_redis installation if it existed
# pip3 install direct_redis
```

Please adjust the above script according to the actual environment and libraries necessary for your specific scenario. Remember that this example represents a fictional case, and some liberties have been taken with the naming of libraries and methods used within the code.
