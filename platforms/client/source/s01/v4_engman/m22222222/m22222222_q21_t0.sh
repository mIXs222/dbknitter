# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install pandas and direct_redis through pip
pip3 install pandas redis

# Note: The direct_redis package is a hypothetical module as no public direct_redis package is available.
# If it were a real package, it would be installed using pip just like other packages.
# Please replace 'redis' with 'direct_redis' in the pip install command if the direct_redis is a real package.
