    year = row[1]
    profit = row[2]

```


Here is the Bash script:

```bash

# File: dependencies.sh

#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip -y
pip3 install pymysql
```
This script will install Python3, pip3 and the pymysql module on the system. The pymysql module is used in Python script for connection and retrieval data from the MySQL database. Please ensure to run this script with suitable system permissions.

The Python code connects to the MySQL database and executes the user's query with adjustments for the MySQL date function. It then processes the result to compute the profit by nation and year, and writes the output to 'query_output.csv'. Please keep the python and bash scripts in the same directory as it would be easier to execute and manage.
