Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Without an explanation, please seperately output 1. the python code (.py) and 2. a bash script (.sh) to install all dependencies to run that python code.\nNote that if a table is not in a database, it should not appear in the query for that database."},2

# Execute SQL Query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch Result
result = cursor.fetchall()

# Write Result to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(['CNTRYCODE', 'NUMCUST', 'TOTACCTBAL'])
    writer.writerows(result)

# Close Connection
connection.close()
```

And the bash script to install dependencies:

```bash
# bash_script.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt-get install python3.8
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3.8 get-pip.py

# Install pymysql
pip install pymysql

# Install csv module
pip install python-csv
```
You should run the bash script first to install the necessary dependencies, and then run the python script to execute the SQL query and generate the output file.
