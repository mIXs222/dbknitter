response, Here is the python code:

```python
# File: execute_query.py
import pymysql
import csv

db = pymysql.connect("mysql","root","my-secret-pw","tpch")
cursor = db.cursor()

cursor.execute("""

       S_ACCTBAL,
       S_NAME,
       N_NAME,

       S_ADDRESS,
       S_PHONE,
       S_COMMENT
    FROM
        part,
        supplier,
        partsupp,

rows = cursor.fetchall()

with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(rows)

db.close()
```

And here is the bash script to install the required dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: install_dependencies.sh

apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pymysql
```

These scripts will install Python, pip (Python's package manager), and PyMySQL (a Python library to interact with MySQL server), and will execute the SQL query and store the result in a file named 'query_output.csv'.
