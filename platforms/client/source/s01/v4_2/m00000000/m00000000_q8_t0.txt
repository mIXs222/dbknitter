response, Here are the python code and bash script to satisfy your needs. 

1. Python Code (data_query.py)

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
import csv
import pymysql

# connect to mysql
db_connection = pymysql.connect(host="mysql", user="root", password="my-secret-pw", db="tpch")
cursor = db_connection.cursor()

def to_csv(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerows(data)

def extract_data(sql_query):
    cursor.execute(sql_query)
    data = cursor.fetchall()
    return data

sql_queries = [
    "SELECT * FROM nation",
    "SELECT * FROM region",

    "SELECT * FROM lineitem"
]

for sql_query in sql_queries:

    filename = f"{os.getcwd()}/{sql_query.split('FROM ')[1]}.csv"
    to_csv(data, filename)

# parts after 'as ALL_NATIONS' is not included and should be processed after this statement in pandas

combined_data = extract_data(sql_query_combined_data)

df_combined_data = pd.DataFrame(combined_data, columns=['O_YEAR', 'VOLUME', 'NATION'])

grouped_data = (df_combined_data
                .groupby(['O_YEAR'])
                .agg(
                    INDIAN_MKT_SHARE = pd.NamedAgg(column='VOLUME', aggfunc = lambda x: sum(df_combined_data['NATION']=='INDIA') / len(x))

                .reset_index())

grouped_data.to_csv('/path/to/save/query_output.csv')
db_connection.close()
```

2. Bash Script (dependencies.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get install -y python3-pip 
pip3 install pandas pymysql
```

Please change '/path/to/save/' in the python code to the actual file path where you would want the 'query_output.csv' to be saved. After these scripts are generated, they need to be run in order. First, make the bash script executable using the command: `chmod +x dependencies.sh` and then run the bash script using the command: `./dependencies.sh`. Once the script finishes and all dependencies are installed, the python script can be run using the command: `python data_query.py`.
