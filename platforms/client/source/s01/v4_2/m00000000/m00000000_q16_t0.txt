response, Here is the Python code:

```python

# create a connection
conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                       user='root',
                       password='my-secret-pw',
                       db='tpch')

# create a cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# define the query
query = """

    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE,
    COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT
FROM
    partsupp,
    part
WHERE
    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY
    AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'

"""

#execute query
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# save the results to csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

```

And here is the shell script to install dependencies:
```sh
# install_dependencies.sh
pip install pymysql pandas sqlalchemy
```
This python code connects to the MySQL database and then execute the SQL query using pandas' `read_sql` function. The results of the query are saved in a dataframe, which is then written to a csv file.

The shell script uses pip to install the required libraries: `pymysql`, `pandas`, and `sqlalchemy`. You can run the shell script with ./install_dependencies.sh. Be sure to run it where python/pip is installed.

Remember to give execute permissions to the shell script with chmod +x install_dependencies.sh if it's not set. You also might need to adjust the python and pip paths depending on your installation.
