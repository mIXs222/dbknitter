This python code uses `pymysql` library to connect with MySQL and `pandas` for handling data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql

# Establish the connection
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='mysql', 
    user='root', 
    password='my-secret-pw', 
    db='tpch'
)

# Create cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# SQL query
query = """

    SUM(VOLUME) AS REVENUE

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all the rows
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Create a DataFrame from rows
df = pd.DataFrame(list(rows), columns=['SUPP_NATION', 'CUST_NATION', 'L_YEAR', 'REVENUE'])

# Write to a CSV file
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

2. Bash Script (`setup.sh`)

This script will install the required python dependencies in a Unix-like environment.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required Python libraries
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install pymysql
```

Please run the bash script as follows: `bash setup.sh` and then run the python script: `python3 query.py`. The output will be written to the `query_output.csv` file.
