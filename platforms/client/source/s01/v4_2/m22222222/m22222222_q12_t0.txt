Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv.

2. Bash Script to Install Dependencies (install_dependencies.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install pandas redis pandasql
```

Please run the bash script through your terminal to install all necessary dependencies before running the Python code. After successfully running the bash script, you should be able to run the python code with the command `python query.py`. After running the Python code, you will find the output file 'query_output.csv' in the same directory.
