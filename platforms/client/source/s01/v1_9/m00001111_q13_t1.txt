Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117).

For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, To execute this SQL query using Python, you'll require the packages pandas, PyMySQL for MySQL databases, and pymongo for MongoDB databases. To install the dependencies use the below bash command (note that pip might be pip3 if you're on python3):

```bash
pip install pandas PyMySQL pymongo
```

Here's the Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pymysql

# configure MySQL connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', 
                             user='root', 
                             password='my-secret-pw', 
                             db='tpch')

# configure MongoDB connection
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# get data from MySQL tables
df_customer = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM customer', mysql_conn)
df_orders = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM orders', mysql_conn)

# get data from MongoDB tables
df_orders_mongo = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['orders'].find()))
df_customer_mongo = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['customer'].find()))

# concat data from MySQL and MongoDB
df_orders = pd.concat([df_orders, df_orders_mongo])
df_customer = pd.concat([df_customer, df_customer_mongo])

# execute the query
query_result = df_customer.merge(df_orders, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
query_result = query_result[~query_result['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', na=False)]
query_result = query_result.groupby('C_CUSTKEY')['O_ORDERKEY'].nunique().reset_index(name='C_COUNT')
query_result = query_result.groupby('C_COUNT').size().reset_index(name='CUSTDIST')
query_result = query_result.sort_values(by=['CUSTDIST', 'C_COUNT'], ascending=[False, False])

# write the result to csv
query_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Please note that this code assumes that the structure of the data retrieved from MongoDB matches that of the data in MySQL. It might not work properly if this is not the case. Always remember to close the MySQL and MongoDB connection after usage.

This Python code does not execute the SQL query directly but recreates its logic using pandas. The SQL query couldn't be run directly due to the data being distributed between two database systems. We first retrieve all the necessary data, then use pandas to achieve the desired result. 

Further note: The query filter `O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'` is not straightforward in pandas. In this solution, it is translated to ~query_result['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', na=False) assuming that 'pending' and 'deposits' can appear anywhere in the 'O_COMMENT' independently. If 'pending' and 'deposits' is a single term that should be matched together, you should use 'pending deposits' instead. Also, this conversion does consider the scenario where particular words are part of other words and would still match ('pending' matches 'impending') which is not the case with SQL LIKE statement. Hence, you might need to adjust the logic based on actual data and requirement.
