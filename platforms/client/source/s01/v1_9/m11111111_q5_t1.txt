For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    N_NAME,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem,\n    supplier,\n    nation,\n    region\nWHERE\n    C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n    AND L_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY\n    AND C_NATIONKEY = S_NATIONKEY\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY\n    AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'\n    AND O_ORDERDATE >= '1990-01-01'\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY\n    N_NAME\nORDER BY\n    REVENUE DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Before we begin, please note that MongoDB is a NoSQL database and does not provide out-of-the-box support for SQL-like joins as per the query you provided. However, MongoDB improvises this with its `aggregate` function and `$lookup` operator which performs a left outer join to an unsharded collection in the same database.

First, let's install the necessary Python libraries.

Bash command to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Here is a Python script:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from bson.son import SON


client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]

pipeline = [
    {"$lookup": {
         "from": "lineitem",
         "localField": "O_ORDERKEY",
         "foreignField": "L_ORDERKEY",
         "as": "lineitem_joined"}},
    {"$unwind": "$lineitem_joined"},
    {"$lookup": {
         "from": "supplier",
         "localField": "lineitem_joined.L_SUPPKEY",
         "foreignField": "S_SUPPKEY",
         "as": "supplier_joined"}},
    {"$unwind": "$supplier_joined"},
    {"$lookup": {
         "from": "nation",
         "localField": "supplier_joined.S_NATIONKEY",
         "foreignField": "N_NATIONKEY",
         "as": "nation_joined"}},
    {"$unwind": "$nation_joined"},
    {"$lookup": {
         "from": "region",
         "localField": "nation_joined.N_REGIONKEY",
         "foreignField": "R_REGIONKEY",
         "as": "region_joined"}},
    {"$unwind": "$region_joined"},
    {"$match": {
         "region_joined.R_NAME": "ASIA",
         "O_ORDERDATE": {"$gte": pd.to_datetime("1990-01-01"), "$lt": pd.to_datetime("1995-01-01")}}},
    {"$group": {
         "_id": "$nation_joined.N_NAME",
         "REVENUE": {"$sum": {"$multiply": ["$lineitem_joined.L_EXTENDEDPRICE", {"$subtract": [1, "$lineitem_joined.L_DISCOUNT"]}]}}}},
    {"$sort": SON([("REVENUE", -1)])}
]

result = db.orders.aggregate(pipeline)

out_df = pd.DataFrame(list(result))
out_df.columns = ['N_NAME', 'REVENUE']
out_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Please replace "O_ORDERDATE" comparison in "$match" stage with actual field names for order date in your MongoDB orders collection.

This script establish a connection with your MongoDB instance, prepares the pipeline needed for aggregation, executes the pipeline on the "orders" collection (which involves joining with other collections), filters the output, performs the grouping and calculation, sorts the final result and exports it as a CSV file.
