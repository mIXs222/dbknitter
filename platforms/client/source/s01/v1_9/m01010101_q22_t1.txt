For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    CNTRYCODE,\n    COUNT(*) AS NUMCUST,\n    SUM(C_ACCTBAL) AS TOTACCTBAL\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        SUBSTR(C_PHONE, 1 , 2) AS CNTRYCODE,\n        C_ACCTBAL\n    FROM\n        customer\n    WHERE\n        SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN\n        ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')\n    AND C_ACCTBAL > (\n            SELECT\n                AVG(C_ACCTBAL)\n            FROM\n                customer\n            WHERE\n                C_ACCTBAL > 0.00\n            AND SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN\n            ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')\n    )\n    AND NOT EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            orders\n        WHERE\n            O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY\n        )\n    ) AS CUSTSALE\nGROUP BY\n    CNTRYCODE\nORDER BY\n    CNTRYCODE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

Bash command to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas pymongo sqlalchemy
```

Notes:
- This Python code assumes that the MongoDB server is running on the same machine as the Python script and is accessible through the default MongoDB port (27017).
- This code also assumes that the MySQL server is running on the same machine as the Python script and is accessible through the root user with password 'my-secret-pw'.
- If either of these assumptions are not accurate, the connection details will need to be modified to match the actual setup.
- The MySQL Client Driver or Connector might need to be installed in your Python environment to establish connection to MySQL. For example, the `PyMySQL` driver can be installed using `pip install PyMySQL`.
