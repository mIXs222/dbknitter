For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    N_NAME,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem,\n    supplier,\n    nation,\n    region\nWHERE\n    C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n    AND L_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY\n    AND C_NATIONKEY = S_NATIONKEY\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY\n    AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'\n    AND O_ORDERDATE >= '1990-01-01'\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY\n    N_NAME\nORDER BY\n    REVENUE DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, To address the differences between the assumed database structure and the actual one, you'll need to utilize different DB engines for different queries. Here, Python's libraries `mysql-connector-python` and `pymongo` can be used to connect to MySQL and MongoDB respectively.

Also, the query you've given cannot be executed directly on the current database structure as it involves joining tables stored in different databases (MySQL and MongoDB) which isn't directly possible. One solution is to execute parts of the query on each database separately, and then join the results within the Python script. Keep in mind that this may be an inefficient solution for large datasets.

Here's the Python code for this task:

```python
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from functools import reduce

# MySQL connection & query
mysql_conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw',
                              host='mysql', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

mysql_query_1 = ("SELECT N_NAME, C_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERKEY, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, L_DISCOUNT "
                "FROM nation, customer, orders, lineitem "
                "WHERE C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY AND "
                "L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY AND "
                "C_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY AND "
                "O_ORDERDATE >= '1990-01-01' AND "
                "O_ORDERDATE < '1995-01-01'")

mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query_1)
mysql_df_1 = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cursor.fetchall(), 
                          columns=['N_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'L_EXTENDEDPRICE', 'L_DISCOUNT'])

mysql_conn.close()

# MongoDB connection & query
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

region_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['region'].find({'R_NAME': 'ASIA'}, {'_id':0, 'R_REGIONKEY':1})))
supplier_df = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db['supplier'].find({}, {'_id':0, 'S_SUPPKEY':1, 'S_NATIONKEY':1})))

dfs = [region_df, supplier_df, mysql_df_1]

# merge all dataframes on common keys
df_final = reduce(lambda left,right: pd.merge(left,right), dfs)
df_final['REVENUE'] = df_final['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - df_final['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Group and order according to the original query
output_df = df_final.groupby('N_NAME').agg({'REVENUE': 'sum'}).sort_values('REVENUE', ascending=False)

output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

To install all the required packages for above Python script using pip in a bash console:
```bash
pip install pandas mysql-connector-python pymongo
```
Please ensure to replace the placeholder values for hostnames, passwords, etc. with the valid ones for your databases. Also, note that if you're dealing with large datasets, this approach may not be very efficient, and you should consider other ways like exporting data or using a data processing framework.
