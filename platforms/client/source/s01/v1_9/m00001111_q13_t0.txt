For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, To execute this, we will use the PyMongo package to connect to MongoDB only and to fetch data from all three MongoDB collections: partsupp, customer, orders, and lineitem. We also use PyMySQL to connect to MySQL to fetch data from  NATION, REGION, PART, and SUPPLIER tables. Then we will create local pandas' dataframes from these collections and tables, and will use them to execute the SQL like query. 

First off, install necessary Python libraries by using pip in the command line:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas pymysql
```

Here is the python code:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
import pymongo

# MySQL connection details
mysql_db_name = "tpch"
mysql_username = "root"
mysql_password = "my-secret-pw"
mysql_hostname = "mysql"
mysql_port = 3306

# MongoDB connection details
mongodb_db_name = "tpch"
mongodb_hostname = "mongodb"
mongodb_port = 27017

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_connection = pymysql.connect(host=mysql_hostname, user=mysql_username, password=mysql_password, db=mysql_db_name)
df_customer_mysql = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM customer', con=mysql_connection)

# Connect to MongoDB 
mongodb_connection = pymongo.MongoClient(mongodb_hostname, mongodb_port)
mongodb_database = mongodb_connection[mongodb_db_name]

# Fetch data from MongoDB into Pandas DataFrames
df_customer_mongodb = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb_database.customer.find()))
df_orders = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb_database.orders.find()))

# Merge customer data from MySQL and MongoDB
df_customer = pd.concat([df_customer_mysql, df_customer_mongodb])

# Perform the left JOIN and filtering 
C_ORDERS = pd.merge(df_customer, df_orders, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on = 'O_CUSTKEY', how='left')
C_ORDERS = C_ORDERS[C_ORDERS['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('%pending%deposits%') == False]

# Perform the GROUP BY and count
C_ORDERS_grouped = C_ORDERS.groupby('C_CUSTKEY').agg({'O_ORDERKEY': pd.Series.nunique})

# Perform a final GROUP BY and sort
final_df = C_ORDERS_grouped.groupby('O_ORDERKEY').size().reset_index(name='CUSTDIST').sort_values(by=['CUSTDIST','O_ORDERKEY'], ascending=False)

# Write the output to a CSV
final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Make sure you replace the connection details such as the hostnames, usernames, and passwords, with your actual MongoDB and MySQL data in the above python code where necessary. 

This python code will generate 'query_output.csv' as output file.

Note: Please make sure PyMongo and Pandas libraries are installed in your python environment. If you haven't installed them yet, you can install these libraries by pip install command: pip install pymongo pandas.
