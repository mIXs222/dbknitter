Table region has the following fields: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152).

Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table orders has the following fields: O_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, O_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, O_ORDERSTATUS of type CHAR(1), O_TOTALPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), O_ORDERDATE of type DATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY of type CHAR(15), O_CLERK of type CHAR(15), O_SHIPPRIORITY of type INTEGER and O_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(79).

For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, To execute a SQL-like query on MongoDB data, we require certain dependencies. First we can use the PyMongo library to interact with MongoDB and then pandas, another python library, to execute SQL-like queries and to write output to csv. 

The bash command to install these dependencies is as follows:


```bash
pip install pymongo pandas dnspython pandasql
```

After the installation of the above dependencies, here is the Python code equivalent to your SQL query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from pandasql import sqldf

# This establishes connection with MongoDB client
myclient = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")

# This will select the database
mydb = myclient["tpch"]

# This will select the table
customer_col = mydb["customer"]
orders_col = mydb["orders"]

# This will get the data
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_col.find({},{'_id':0})))
orders_data = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_col.find({},{'_id':0})))

# This will merge both the dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(customer_data, orders_data, left_on = 'C_CUSTKEY', right_on = 'O_CUSTKEY', how = 'left')

# This will filter the data
merged_df = merged_df[~merged_df.O_COMMENT.str.contains('pending deposits', na = False)]

# This applies Group By on the dataframe
grouped_df = merged_df.groupby(['C_CUSTKEY'], as_index = False).agg({'O_ORDERKEY' : 'count'}).rename(columns = {'O_ORDERKEY' : 'C_COUNT'})

# This runs the SQL Query
sqldf_run = sqldf("SELECT C_COUNT, COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST FROM grouped_df GROUP BY C_COUNT ORDER BY CUSTDIST DESC, C_COUNT DESC")

# This writes to csv
sqldf_run.to_csv('query_output.csv', index = False)
```

You need to replace 'your_mongodb_uri' with your mongodb uri connection string. You can find this in MongoDB Atlas. Also if your user requires password you need to include that in connection string as well.
