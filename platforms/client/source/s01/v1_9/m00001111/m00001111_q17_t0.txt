Table REGION has the following columns: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table orders has the following fields: O_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, O_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, O_ORDERSTATUS of type CHAR(1), O_TOTALPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), O_ORDERDATE of type DATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY of type CHAR(15), O_CLERK of type CHAR(15), O_SHIPPRIORITY of type INTEGER and O_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(79). Table lineitem has the following fields: L_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, L_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, L_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, L_LINENUMBER of type INTEGER, L_QUANTITY of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_EXTENDEDPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_DISCOUNT of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_TAX of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_RETURNFLAG of type CHAR(1), L_LINESTATUS of type CHAR(1), L_SHIPDATE of type DATE, L_COMMITDATE of type DATE, L_RECEIPTDATE of type DATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT of type CHAR(25), L_SHIPMODE of type CHAR(10) and L_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(44). \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table NATION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'\n    AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'\n    AND L_QUANTITY < (\n        SELECT\n            0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY)\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY\n    )\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the python code that you need:

```python
import pymongo
import mysql.connector
from pandas import DataFrame

def main():
    mysql_conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', database='tpch')
    mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

    mongo_conn = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
    mongo_db = mongo_conn['tpch']

    lineitem_collection = mongo_db['lineitem']
    partsupp_collection = mongo_db['partsupp']

    query = "SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_BRAND, P_CONTAINER FROM PART WHERE P_BRAND = 'Brand#23' AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'"
    mysql_cursor.execute(query)
    parts_result = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

    avg_yearly = 0
    for record in parts_result:
        partkey, _, _ = record
        lineitems = lineitem_collection.find({'L_PARTKEY': partkey})
        quantities = [i['L_QUANTITY'] for i in lineitems]
        avg_quantity = sum(quantities) / len(quantities) if quantities else 0
        lineitems = lineitem_collection.find({'L_PARTKEY': partkey , 'L_QUANTITY': {'$lt': 0.2 * avg_quantity}})
        extended_prices = [i['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] for i in lineitems]
        avg_yearly += sum(extended_prices)

    avg_yearly /= 7.0
    
    df = DataFrame([avg_yearly], columns=["AVG_YEARLY"])
    df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

    mysql_cursor.close()
    mysql_conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The above python code first connect to mysql and mongodb. It then get the partkey from PART table from the mysql and match those with lineitem in mongodb getting average quantity and extended prices. The result is then saved in a csv file.

Here is the set of bash commands to install the dependencies for running the python code:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas mysql-connector-python
