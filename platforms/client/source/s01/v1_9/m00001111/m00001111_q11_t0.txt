For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    PS_PARTKEY,\n    SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) AS VALUE\nFROM\n    partsupp,\n    supplier,\n    nation\nWHERE\n    PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'\nGROUP BY\n    PS_PARTKEY HAVING\n    SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) >\n    (\n    SELECT\n        SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) * 0.0001000000\n    FROM\n        partsupp,\n        supplier,\n        nation\n    WHERE\n        PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY\n        AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n        AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'\n    )\nORDER BY\n    VALUE DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is a Python code to execute the given query assuming that the MySQL server and MongoDB server are running and have the necessary databases and tables.

Before running the Python script, the Python-based MongoDB driver "Pymongo" and "mysql-connector-python" should be installed.

```bash
pip install pymongo
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pandas
```

Python Code:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# Connection to MySQL
mysql_conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', database='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# Connection to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]

# Fetch data from MySQL
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT S_SUPPKEY, S_NATIONKEY FROM supplier, nation WHERE S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'")
mysql_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

suppliers = [row[0] for row in mysql_data if row]
nations = [row[1] for row in mysql_data if row]

# Query MongoDB partsupp
mongo_query = { "$and": [ { "PS_SUPPKEY": { "$in": suppliers } }, { "PS_AVAILQTY": { "$gt": 0 } } ] }
mongo_docs = mongo_db.partsupp.find(mongo_query)

# Prepare data for pandas DataFrame
data = [(doc['PS_PARTKEY'], doc['PS_SUPPLYCOST'] * doc['PS_AVAILQTY']) for doc in mongo_docs]

# Perform groupby operation using pandas
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['PS_PARTKEY', 'VALUE'])
grouped = df.groupby('PS_PARTKEY').sum()

# Filter rows based on the given condition
threshold = grouped['VALUE'].sum() * 0.0001000000
filtered = grouped[grouped['VALUE'] > threshold]

# Sort and save to csv
result = filtered.sort_values('VALUE', ascending=False)
result.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

Bear in mind that this is a very high-level solution and may need adjustments depending on the actual data sizes, specific configurations, and environment settings. Also, all tables(fields) should have the same name and schema in MongoDB with MySQL.
