For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_NAME,\n    C_CUSTKEY,\n    O_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_TOTALPRICE,\n    SUM(L_QUANTITY)\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY IN (\n    SELECT\n        L_ORDERKEY\n    FROM\n        lineitem\n    GROUP BY\n    L_ORDERKEY HAVING\n        SUM(L_QUANTITY) > 300\n    )\nAND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\nAND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\nGROUP BY\n    C_NAME,\n    C_CUSTKEY,\n    O_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_TOTALPRICE\nORDER BY\n    O_TOTALPRICE DESC,\n    O_ORDERDATE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Firstly, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this with the following bash command:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo pandas
```

The following is the python script that executes the query. This script firstly fetches the data from the MYSQL and MongoDB databases, and then performs the required operation:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# Getting data from MySQL
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customer")
customer = pd.DataFrame(mycursor.fetchall(), columns=["C_CUSTKEY", "C_NAME", "C_ADDRESS", "C_NATIONKEY", "C_PHONE", "C_ACCTBAL", "C_MKTSEGMENT", "C_COMMENT"])

mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders")
orders = pd.DataFrame(mycursor.fetchall(), columns=["O_ORDERKEY", "O_CUSTKEY", "O_ORDERSTATUS", "O_TOTALPRICE", "O_ORDERDATE", "O_ORDERPRIORITY", "O_CLERK", "O_SHIPPRIORITY", "O_COMMENT"])

mydb.close()

# Getting data from MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]

lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find()), columns=["L_ORDERKEY", "L_PARTKEY", "L_SUPPKEY", "L_LINENUMBER", "L_QUANTITY", "L_EXTENDEDPRICE", "L_DISCOUNT", "L_TAX", "L_RETURNFLAG", "L_LINESTATUS", "L_SHIPDATE", "L_COMMITDATE", "L_RECEIPTDATE", "L_SHIPINSTRUCT", "L_SHIPMODE","L_COMMENT"])

# Performing query operation
grouped_lineitem = lineitem.groupby('L_ORDERKEY').sum().reset_index()
filtered_lineitem = grouped_lineitem[grouped_lineitem['L_QUANTITY'] > 300][['L_ORDERKEY', 'L_QUANTITY']]

merged_df = pd.merge(customer, orders, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, filtered_lineitem, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

grouped_df = merged_df.groupby(['C_NAME','C_CUSTKEY','O_ORDERKEY','O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE'])['L_QUANTITY'].sum().reset_index()

result = grouped_df.sort_values(by=['O_TOTALPRICE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])
result.to_csv('query_output.csv')

```

To run this python script, just save it into a `.py` file and execute it. It first connects to your MySQL and MongoDB databases, fetches all tables, merges and groups data as per your query and then stores the result in a CSV file.

Please note that you have to replace the placeholders in the code with your actual server, DB names, credentials (wherever required) as per your environment.

This is a Python script and hence does not require to be run on a specific operating system. However, the system must have Python installed (preferably Python 3) and the mentioned libraries/packages must be installed for the Python environment in which you are running this script. Please use pip to install these requirements, pip is standard with Python 3.
