For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'\n    AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'\nGROUP BY\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nORDER BY\n    REVENUE DESC,\n    O_ORDERDATE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Your original data resides in two different types of databases: MySQL and MongoDB. The query that the user of your data wrote is assuming that all data is in a relational database format, typical of MySQL. Unfortunately, due to the different structures of the data in the two different database types, this query cannot simply be run on MongoDB in its current SQL format. 

You need to connect to both databases, fetch the relevant data from each database with their respective query languages (SQL for MySQL and native MongoDB method for MongoDB), adjust relational connections manually and then process the data in Python to generate the results.

Before proceeding though, make sure to install necessary Python libraries with the following Bash command:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo pandas
```

Here is the Python code:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_db.cursor()

# Execute SQL query on MySQL
mysql_cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM customer')
customers = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cursor.fetchall(), columns=[column[0] for column in mysql_cursor.description])

mysql_cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM orders')
orders = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cursor.fetchall(), columns=[column[0] for column in mysql_cursor.description])

# Close MySQL connection
mysql_cursor.close()
mysql_db.close()

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = client['tpch']

# Query MongoDB database
lineitems_records = mongodb.lineitem.find()

# Convert MongoDB data to DataFrame
lineitems = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitems_records))

# Merge, filter and group data with pandas
cond1 = lineitems['L_SHIPDATE'] > '1995-03-15'
data = pd.merge(customers, orders, left_on="C_CUSTKEY", right_on="O_CUSTKEY")
data = pd.merge(data, lineitems[cond1], left_on="O_ORDERKEY", right_on="L_ORDERKEY")
data = data[data['C_MKTSEGMENT']=='BUILDING']
data = data[data['O_ORDERDATE'] < '1995-03-15']
data['REVENUE'] = data['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - data['L_DISCOUNT'])
grouped = data.groupby(['L_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'])['REVENUE'].sum().reset_index()

# Sort data and write to csv
result = grouped.sort_values(['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending=[False, True])
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```
The query above assumes that MongoDB documents have the same structure as corresponding MySQL tables.

Keep in mind, Python's MongoDB driver does not support SQL, so extraction is handled in the Python script rather than the MongoDB query. Using a full featured ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like SQLAlchemy for Python would simplify some of these processes, particularly when dealing with relationships across multiple tables or collections.
