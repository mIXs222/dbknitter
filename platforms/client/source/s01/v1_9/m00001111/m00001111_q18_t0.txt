For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_NAME,\n    C_CUSTKEY,\n    O_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_TOTALPRICE,\n    SUM(L_QUANTITY)\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY IN (\n    SELECT\n        L_ORDERKEY\n    FROM\n        lineitem\n    GROUP BY\n    L_ORDERKEY HAVING\n        SUM(L_QUANTITY) > 300\n    )\nAND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\nAND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\nGROUP BY\n    C_NAME,\n    C_CUSTKEY,\n    O_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_TOTALPRICE\nORDER BY\n    O_TOTALPRICE DESC,\n    O_ORDERDATE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, Firstly, you need to install the required dependencies in your Python environment. To install these, you can run the following bash commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymongo
```

Given the details in the prompt, I am assuming that we're using MySQL Connector/Python to connect to your MySQL database and PyMongo to connect to MongoDB. 

Python script can be as mentioned below:

```python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Setting up MySQL connection
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(host="mysql", user="root", passwd="my-secret-pw", database="tpch")
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Setting up MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = client["tpch"]

# reading all the data from MongoDB collections
partsupp_data = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.partsupp.find()))
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.customer.find()))
orders_data = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.orders.find()))
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb.lineitem.find()))

# Query on MongoDB dataframes
df_lineitem_group = lineitem_data.groupby("L_ORDERKEY")["L_QUANTITY"].sum().reset_index()
df_lineitem_group = df_lineitem_group[df_lineitem_group["L_QUANTITY"] > 300]

merged_data = pd.merge(customer_data, orders_data, left_on="C_CUSTKEY", right_on="O_CUSTKEY")
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, lineitem_data, on="L_ORDERKEY")
merged_data = merged_data[merged_data["O_ORDERKEY"].isin(df_lineitem_group["L_ORDERKEY"])]

final_data = merged_data.groupby(["C_NAME", "C_CUSTKEY", "O_ORDERKEY", "O_ORDERDATE", "O_TOTALPRICE"])["L_QUANTITY"].sum().reset_index()
final_data = final_data.sort_values(by=["O_TOTALPRICE", "O_ORDERDATE"], ascending=[False, True])

final_data.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

This python script reads the tables (in your case collections in MongoDB) and performs operations on those dataframe to get the required output. Finally, the output is written to 'query_output.csv' file. 

Please make sure to install the following python packages - pandas, mysql-connector-python and pymongo using pip before running this script. 

It's important to note that executing SQL-like operations on pandas DataFrames can be inefficient with large amounts of data because these operations are not optimized to perform well on large data sets. Also MongoDB is a document database where we normally not perform SQL-like operations. If performance becomes an issue, you might want to consider other approaches such as rewriting the SQL query to execute within each database system (i.e., MySQL and MongoDB) and reducing data size before loading into pandas DataFrame, or moving all the data into a single database system that can handle SQL-like operations well, such as MySQL or a distributed SQL database system.
