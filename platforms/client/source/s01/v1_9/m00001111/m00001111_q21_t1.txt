Table REGION has the following columns: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table orders has the following fields: O_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, O_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, O_ORDERSTATUS of type CHAR(1), O_TOTALPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), O_ORDERDATE of type DATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY of type CHAR(15), O_CLERK of type CHAR(15), O_SHIPPRIORITY of type INTEGER and O_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(79).

For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    S_NAME,\n    COUNT(*) AS NUMWAIT\nFROM\n    supplier,\n    lineitem AS L1,\n    orders,\n    nation\nWHERE\n    S_SUPPKEY = L1.L_SUPPKEY\n    AND O_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY\n    AND O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'\n    AND L1.L_RECEIPTDATE > L1.L_COMMITDATE\n    AND EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            lineitem AS L2\n        WHERE\n            L2.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY\n            AND L2.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY\n    )\n    AND NOT EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            lineitem AS L3\n        WHERE\n            L3.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY\n            AND L3.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY\n            AND L3.L_RECEIPTDATE > L3.L_COMMITDATE\n        )\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'\nGROUP BY\n    S_NAME\n    ORDER BY\n    NUMWAIT DESC,\n    S_NAME\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

Bash installation command:

`pip install pandas pymongo sqlalchemy pymysql`

This python code and bash installation command are for a unix-like OS such as Linux or MacOS. If you're using another OS, you might need to modify the installation command. Also, keep in mind this python code should be run using python3.7 or later to ensure compatibility with all dependencies. 

Please note that MongoDB is not meant for complex operations like those in your query but this Python code tries its best to replicate the given SQL query operations. SQLAlchemy and Pymongo are used for connecting with MySQL and MongoDB respectively.
