For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.

For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    S_NAME,\n    COUNT(*) AS NUMWAIT\nFROM\n    supplier,\n    lineitem AS L1,\n    orders,\n    nation\nWHERE\n    S_SUPPKEY = L1.L_SUPPKEY\n    AND O_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY\n    AND O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F'\n    AND L1.L_RECEIPTDATE > L1.L_COMMITDATE\n    AND EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            lineitem AS L2\n        WHERE\n            L2.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY\n            AND L2.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY\n    )\n    AND NOT EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            lineitem AS L3\n        WHERE\n            L3.L_ORDERKEY = L1.L_ORDERKEY\n            AND L3.L_SUPPKEY <> L1.L_SUPPKEY\n            AND L3.L_RECEIPTDATE > L3.L_COMMITDATE\n        )\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA'\nGROUP BY\n    S_NAME\n    ORDER BY\n    NUMWAIT DESC,\n    S_NAME\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, Since your data is split across two different types of databases (MySQL and MongoDB), a single SQL query as the one provided will not work. You need to work with both databases separately and integrate them in your final result. 

Of course, this might be not the exact answer you're looking for because a lot of details very specific to your data setup were omitted in the request and I based the solution on assumptions. The code below is a general idea of the kind of process you need to follow.

First, install the necessary libraries for Python with the following command:

```bash
pip install pymongo mysql-connector-python pandas
```

Here is the Python code that you can use as a base to extract and combine your data:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# SQL database connection
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw',
                              host='mysql', database='tpch')
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]
partsupp = db.partsupp

# Query MySQL
query = ("SELECT S_NAME, S_NATIONKEY FROM supplier WHERE S_NATIONKEY IN "
         "(SELECT N_NATIONKEY FROM nation WHERE N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA')")

cursor.execute(query)

suppliers = []
for (S_NAME, S_NATIONKEY) in cursor:
    suppliers.append({'S_NAME': S_NAME, 'S_NATIONKEY': S_NATIONKEY})

# Query MongoDB
lineitem = db.lineitem.find({
                    'L_SUPPKEY': {'$in': [s['S_SUPPKEY'] for s in suppliers]}, 
                    'L_RECEIPTDATE': { '$gt': 'L_COMMITDATE' }
                }, {'L_SUPPKEY': 1} )

# Aggregate the data
result = {}
for item in lineitem:
    suppkey = item['L_SUPPKEY']
    supplier = next((s for s in suppliers if s['S_SUPPKEY'] == suppkey), None)

    if supplier['S_NAME'] not in result:
        result[supplier['S_NAME']] = 0
    result[supplier['S_NAME']] += 1

# Write output 
df = pd.DataFrame(result.items(), columns=['S_NAME', 'NUMWAIT'])
