For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT\nFROM\n    partsupp,\n    part\nWHERE\n    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'\n    AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'\n    AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)\n    AND PS_SUPPKEY NOT IN (\n        SELECT\n            S_SUPPKEY\n        FROM\n            supplier\n        WHERE\n            S_COMMENT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'\n    )\nGROUP BY\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE\nORDER BY\n    SUPPLIER_CNT DESC,\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, Firstly, remember that you have a mixed database with MySQL and MongoDB, so a single query like the one you have there won't work straight out of the box because it's all written in SQL and your user is assuming that all data resides in MySQL. Instead, from Python, you need to perform separate queries to MySQL and MongoDB, preprocess the data, and then use pandas library to accomplish the same result.

Please note that the given code is a basic representation of how to execute the query and may need to be adjusted according to exact database schema, particularly to the structure of data in MongoDB.

Here is your python code:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd
import pymongo

# Connect to MySQL
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

mysql_cursor = mydb.cursor()
mysql_cursor.execute('''SELECT * FROM part WHERE P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45' 
                        AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%' 
                        AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)''')
part_table = pd.DataFrame(mysql_cursor.fetchall(), columns=[*map(lambda x: x[0], mysql_cursor.description)])

mysql_cursor.execute('''SELECT S_SUPPKEY FROM supplier WHERE S_COMMENT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%' ''')
excluded_suppliers = list(map(lambda x: x[0], mysql_cursor.fetchall()))

# Connect to MongoDB
myclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongodb = myclient["tpch"]
partsupp_table = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb["partsupp"].find()))

filtered_partsupp_table = partsupp_table[~partsupp_table["PS_SUPPKEY"].isin(excluded_suppliers)]
merged_result = pd.merge(part_table, filtered_partsupp_table,left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='PS_PARTKEY')

grouped_result = merged_result.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE']).agg(SUPPLIER_CNT=('PS_SUPPKEY', 'nunique')).reset_index().sort_values(['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])
grouped_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

To run this Python script you will need to do a pip install of the following libraries:
pandas, mysql-connector-python, pymongo

Here is the bash command to install these python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas mysql-connector-python pymongo
