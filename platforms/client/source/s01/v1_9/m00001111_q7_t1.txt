For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUPP_NATION,\n    CUST_NATION,\n    L_YEAR,\n    SUM(VOLUME) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        N1.N_NAME AS SUPP_NATION,\n        N2.N_NAME AS CUST_NATION,\n        strftime('%Y', L_SHIPDATE) AS L_YEAR,\n        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME\n    FROM\n        supplier,\n        lineitem,\n        orders,\n        customer,\n        nation n1,\n        nation n2\n    WHERE\n        S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY\n        AND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\n        AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND S_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND C_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND (\n            (N1.N_NAME = 'JAPAN' AND N2.N_NAME = 'INDIA')\n            OR (N1.N_NAME = 'INDIA' AND N2.N_NAME = 'JAPAN')\n            )\n        AND L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'\n    ) AS SHIPPING\nGROUP BY\n    SUPP_NATION,\n    CUST_NATION,\n    L_YEAR\nORDER BY\n    SUPP_NATION,\n    CUST_NATION,\n    L_YEAR\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Python code to access different databases (MySQL and MongoDB) in parallel and perform complex queries and generate the desired output is as follows. The python script uses pandas for DataFrame operations, pymysql and pymongo for database connectivity.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import pymongo
from datetime import datetime as dt
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# Connect to MySQL
mydb = pymysql.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password="my-secret-pq",
    database="tpch"
)

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017")
mdb = client["tpch"]

# Read customers from MongoDB
customer_cursor = mdb.customer.find({})
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_cursor))

# Read lineitems from MongoDB
lineitem_cursor = mdb.lineitem.find({})
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_cursor))

# Read orders from MongoDB
orders_cursor = mdb.orders.find({})
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_cursor))

# Read suppliers from MySQL
supplier_df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM SUPPLIER', con=mydb)

# Read nation from MySQL
nation_df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM NATION', con=mydb)

# Query Execution
filtered_data = pd.merge(supplier_df, lineitem_df, left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='L_SUPPKEY')
filtered_data = pd.merge(filtered_data, orders_df, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')
filtered_data = pd.merge(filtered_data, customer_df, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')
filtered_data = pd.merge(filtered_data, nation_df, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
filtered_data.rename(columns = {'N_NAME':'SUPP_NATION'}, inplace = True)
filtered_data = pd.merge(filtered_data, nation_df, left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY')
filtered_data.rename(columns = {'N_NAME':'CUST_NATION'}, inplace = True)
filtered_data = filtered_data[(filtered_data['L_SHIPDATE'] > dt.strptime('1995-01-01', '%Y-%m-%d')) & (filtered_data['L_SHIPDATE'] < dt.strptime('1996-12-31', '%Y-%m-%d'))]

filtered_data['VOLUME'] = filtered_data['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_data['L_DISCOUNT'])
filtered_data = filtered_data.groupby(['SUPP_NATION', 'CUST_NATION', filtered_data.L_SHIPDATE.dt.year, 'VOLUME']).sum()
filtered_data.reset_index().to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

To run this script you need to install following python packages:
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install PyMySQL
pip install pymongo
```
Take into account that you might need to install these dependencies according to the specific environment in which you are running python. It's also quite likely you'll need to update the database connection parameters, both for MySQL and MongoDB, in order to successfully connect to these databases.
