For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#12'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 1 AND L_QUANTITY <= 1 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n    OR\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 10 AND L_QUANTITY <= 10 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n    OR\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#34'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 20 AND L_QUANTITY <= 20 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, The best way to execute complex SQL like queries in MongoDB is by using the PyMongo library in Python.

Here are the bash commands for installing required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pymongo
pip install pandas
```
Please note environment should be Python 3.6 or above.

Below is the python script to execute your query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Function to connect to MongoDB
def connect_mongo():
    client = MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')
    db = client['tpch']
    return db

# Function to execute condition check
def check_condition(p, l):
    conditions = [
        (
            p['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#12'
            and p['P_CONTAINER'] in ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
            and l['L_QUANTITY'] >= 1 
            and l['L_QUANTITY'] <= 11 
            and p['P_SIZE'] between 1 and 5
        ),
        (
            p['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23'
            and p['P_CONTAINER'] in ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
            and l['L_QUANTITY'] >= 10 
            and l['L_QUANTITY'] <= 20 
            and p['P_SIZE'] between 1 and 10
        ),
        (
            p['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#34'
            and p['P_CONTAINER'] in ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
            and l['L_QUANTITY'] >= 20 
            and l['L_QUANTITY'] <= 30 
            and p['P_SIZE'] between 1 and 15
        )
    ]
    return any(conditions)


def main():
    # Connect to MongoDB
    db = connect_mongo()

    results = []

    # Iterating through all documents in collections "part" and "lineitem"
    for p in db.part.find():
        for l in db.lineitem.find():
            # Check if partkey equals and conditions meet
            if p['P_PARTKEY'] == l['L_PARTKEY'] and l['L_SHIPMODE'] in ('AIR', 'AIR REG') and l['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON' and check_condition(p, l):
                results.append(l['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - l['L_DISCOUNT']))
    
    # Calculating sum
    sum_result = sum(results)
    
    # Writing result to csv file
    pd.DataFrame([sum_result], columns=["REVENUE"]).to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Save this script into a .py file and run it using python3 <filename.py>.

Please be aware that running this script may take a long time if you have a large volume of data because it uses a nested loop to check all possible combinations of documents in your part and lineitem collection.

If you have an extremely large data set, consider using a distributed computing system like Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark to handle this more effectively. 

This script assumes that your MongoDB server is running on the default port 27017 on a host named 'mongodb'. If this is not the case, you need to adjust 'mongodb://mongodb:27017/' to match your MongoDB instance's actual host and port.
