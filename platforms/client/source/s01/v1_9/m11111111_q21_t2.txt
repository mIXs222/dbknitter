response, This task implies rewriting the SQL query to conform to the MongoDB query language. Unfortunately, while MongoDB supports many powerful query and aggregation operations, it doesn't provide 1 to 1 support for MySQL like join and subquery syntax. 

Therefore, to achieve the exact same result as the given SQL query, the query would need to be totally rewritten with a complex aggregation pipeline and it might not be possible to get exact output. It would involve multiple iterations over your data, making it significantly less efficient compared to a SQL based DBMS for this specific type of query.

However, here is a Python script for connecting to MongoDB and an example of how you might execute a simple find query:

```Python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Create a client instance
client = MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')

# Connect to the desired database
db = client['tpch']

# Perform a simple find operation
cursor = db['supplier'].find({})

# For displaying output in csv
output = []

# Iterating the cursor
for document in cursor:
    output.append(document)

# Convert to dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(output)

# Write to csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Installing pymongo and pandas using pip:
```Bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Remember, this script only executes a simple find operation (which is analogous to SELECT * in SQL). The actual complexity of this task lies in converting the provided SQL query into MongoDB's query language, which due to MongoDB's schema-less and non-relational nature might be complex and less efficient. This is why for complex relational queries, a SQL based DBMS is often more suitable. 

Another solution could be to preprocess your data in such a way that you would not need to rely on complex queries for extracting information. However, this approach depends heavily on the needs and structure of your project.
