response, Here is the correct Python script but it is important to understand that MongoDB does not have native support for SQL queries. Therefore, in order to get data from MongoDb we need to use a MongoDB client like PyMongo and write our queries according to it. Let's take a look at the Python script:

Firstly, you need to start with the Python and relevant dependencies installation. 

bash command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install pandas PyMySQL pymongo simplejson
```

Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pymongo
import simplejson as json

engine = create_engine("mysql+pymysql://root:my-secret-pw@mysql/tpch")

# Execute SQL on MySQL using pandas
my_sql_query = """
SELECT AVG(C_ACCTBAL) as avg_acctbal FROM customer WHERE C_ACCTBAL > 0.00
"""

avg_acctbal = pd.read_sql(my_sql_query, engine)
avg_acctbal = avg_acctbal['avg_acctbal'][0]

my_client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
my_db = my_client["tpch"]

# Select data from MongoDB
mongo_query = {"$and": [{"C_ACCTBAL": {"$gt": avg_acctbal}}, {"C_PHONE": {"$in": ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']}}]}
projection = {"C_PHONE": 1, "C_ACCTBAL": 1, "_id": 0}
customers = my_db['customer'].find(mongo_query, projection)

# Convert data to pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(list(customers))
df['CNTRYCODE'] = df['C_PHONE'].str[0:2]
df = df[df['CNTRYCODE'].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])]
df = df.groupby('CNTRYCODE').agg({'C_ACCTBAL': ['count', 'sum']}).reset_index()
df.columns = ['CNTRYCODE', 'NUMCUST', 'TOTACCTBAL']

# Write output to csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

This Python script fetches the average account balance from the MySQL database and then uses this value to filter the documents in the MongoDb `customer` collection. This data is then saved to a DataFrame and the number of customers and total account balance per country code are stored in a csv file. 

Please make sure that you have necessary permissions/privileges in mongoDb and MySQL to run the above queries.
