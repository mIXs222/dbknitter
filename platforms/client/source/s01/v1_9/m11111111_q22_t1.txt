For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    CNTRYCODE,\n    COUNT(*) AS NUMCUST,\n    SUM(C_ACCTBAL) AS TOTACCTBAL\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        SUBSTR(C_PHONE, 1 , 2) AS CNTRYCODE,\n        C_ACCTBAL\n    FROM\n        customer\n    WHERE\n        SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN\n        ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')\n    AND C_ACCTBAL > (\n            SELECT\n                AVG(C_ACCTBAL)\n            FROM\n                customer\n            WHERE\n                C_ACCTBAL > 0.00\n            AND SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN\n            ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')\n    )\n    AND NOT EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            orders\n        WHERE\n            O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY\n        )\n    ) AS CUSTSALE\nGROUP BY\n    CNTRYCODE\nORDER BY\n    CNTRYCODE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, To execute the query on your MongoDB data in Python, first you need to install pymongo and pandas libraries that support working with MongoDB and data manipulation respectively.

Here is your bash command to install the Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas dnspython
```

Please note that this process expects that Python and pip are already installed on your system, which is commonly the case for many modern computers. 

Now, let's move to the Python code. Unfortunately, MongoDB doesn't support complex SQL queries directly, it has its own query language mostly focused on JSON-like documents. So, we can read the data from MongoDB into pandas DataFrame using pymongo, then perform the same operations using pandas API which is very flexible and supports many SQL-like operations:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

def mongodb_to_dataframe(db_name, collection_name, query, host="localhost", port=27017, username=None, password=None):
    """ Create a dataframe from mongodb collection """
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(host, username=username, password=password)
    db = client[db_name]
    cursor = db[collection_name].find(query)
    df = pd.DataFrame(list(cursor))
    return df

# Create dataframes for required tables
db_name = "tpch"

customer_df = mongodb_to_dataframe(db_name, "customer", {})
orders_df = mongodb_to_dataframe(db_name, "orders", {})

# Select customers with required phone codes and account balance > average
customer_df["CNTRYCODE"] = customer_df["C_PHONE"].str[:2]
avg_acctbal = customer_df[(customer_df["C_ACCTBAL"] > 0) & customer_df["CNTRYCODE"].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])]["C_ACCTBAL"].mean()
customer_df = customer_df[(customer_df["CNTRYCODE"].isin(['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21'])) & (customer_df["C_ACCTBAL"] > avg_acctbal)]

# Remove customers who exists in orders table
customer_df = customer_df[~customer_df["C_CUSTKEY"].isin(orders_df["O_CUSTKEY"])]

# Group by country code and compute sum of account balance and count
grouped_df = customer_df.groupby("CNTRYCODE").agg({"C_CUSTKEY": "count", "C_ACCTBAL": "sum"}).reset_index()
grouped_df.rename(columns={"C_CUSTKEY": "NUMCUST", "C_ACCTBAL": "TOTACCTBAL"}, inplace=True)

# Write results to CSV
grouped_df.to_csv("query_output.csv", index=False)
```

To use this script, please replace "localhost" with the actual MongoDB host if it's not running on the same machine where this script is run. Also if your MongoDB is secured, pass the `username` and `password` to `mongodb_to_dataframe`.
