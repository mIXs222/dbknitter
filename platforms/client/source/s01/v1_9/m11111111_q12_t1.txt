For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    L_SHIPMODE,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY = '1-URGENT'\n            OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS HIGH_LINE_COUNT,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '1-URGENT'\n            AND O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS LOW_LINE_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')\n    AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\nORDER BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Firstly, install the following Python modules using pip. Use below command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Here is the Python code to execute above MySQL query on MongoDB database and then writing the result to 'query_output.csv':

```python
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from pandas.io.json import json_normalize

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client['tpch']

# MongoDB queries
orders = db.orders.find({})
lineitem = db.lineitem.find({})

# Normalize JSON to Dataframe
df_orders = json_normalize(list(orders))
df_lineitem = json_normalize(list(lineitem))

# Merge Dataframes on Key
merged_df = pd.merge(df_orders, df_lineitem, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY', how='inner')

# Apply Filters
filtered_df = merged_df[(merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL','SHIP'])) 
                        & (merged_df['L_COMMITDATE'] < merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE']) 
                        & (merged_df['L_SHIPDATE'] < merged_df['L_COMMITDATE']) 
                        & (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') 
                        & (merged_df['L_RECEIPTDATE'] < '1995-01-01')]

# Define function for priority cases
def priority_cases(row):
    if row['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == '1-URGENT' or row['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == '2-HIGH':
        return 'HIGH_LINE_COUNT'
    else:
        return 'LOW_LINE_COUNT'

# Apply function to Dataframe
filtered_df['PRIORITY'] = filtered_df.apply(priority_cases, axis=1)

# Group by shipmode and priority then reset index
grouped_df = filtered_df.groupby(['L_SHIPMODE', 'PRIORITY']).size().reset_index(name='COUNTS')

# Pivot the Dataframe to the final form and fill NaN with 0
pivot_df = grouped_df.pivot_table(index='L_SHIPMODE', columns='PRIORITY', values='COUNTS').fillna(0)

# Write to CSV
pivot_df.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

Please note that datetime comparisons may behave unexpectedly depending on the datetime format in your MongoDB database. If the dates within MongoDB are stored as datetime objects, you may need to convert the string date values used in this example code to datetime objects in Python.
Also, this solution doesn't take indexing into account. For a large database, suitable indexing strategies would significantly increase speed. For Python version < 3.7 use 'json_normalize' without 'pandas'. It should be just 'json_normalize'. This function have been deprecated at version 1.0.0.  And it will be removed in a future version. From now we will use 'pandas.json_normalize'.
