For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    L_SHIPMODE,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY = '1-URGENT'\n            OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS HIGH_LINE_COUNT,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '1-URGENT'\n            AND O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS LOW_LINE_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')\n    AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\nORDER BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the python script to execute the given query on your databases where the 'lineitem' and 'orders' table data are stored in MongoDB.

Python Code:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

# MySQL connection
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

# MongoDB connection
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = client["tpch"]

# get the lineitem MongoDB collection
lineitem_collection = mongo_db["lineitem"]

# get the orders MongoDB collection
orders_collection = mongo_db["orders"]

# Empty dataframe creation for storing joined dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame()

# Iterating through each document in lineitem collection
for lineitem in lineitem_collection.find({}):
    # Filter related orders data from MySQL
    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
    query = "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE O_ORDERKEY = {}".format(lineitem['L_ORDERKEY'])
    mycursor.execute(query)
    orders_data = mycursor.fetchall()

    # Creating dataframe for each lineitem and related orders data
    temp_df = pd.DataFrame(orders_data, columns=[desc[0] for desc in mycursor.description])
    temp_df = temp_df.assign(**lineitem)

    # Appending above dataframe to final dataframe
    df = df.append(temp_df, ignore_index=True)

# Perform operations as per the query description
result = df[(df.L_SHIPMODE.isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) &
            (df.L_COMMITDATE < df.L_RECEIPTDATE) &
            (df.L_SHIPDATE < df.L_COMMITDATE) &
            (df.L_RECEIPTDATE >= '1994-01-01') &
            (df.L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01')]

result['HIGH_LINE_COUNT'] = result.apply(
    lambda x: 1 if x['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == '1-URGENT' or x['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == '2-HIGH' else 0,
    axis=1
)

result['LOW_LINE_COUNT'] = result.apply(
    lambda x: 1 if x['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] != '1-URGENT' and x['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] != '2-HIGH' else 0,
    axis=1
)

output = result.groupby('L_SHIPMODE').agg({'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': 'sum', 'LOW_LINE_COUNT': 'sum'})

# Write result to csv
output.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

Bash command to install necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo pandas
```

Note:

1. The above Python script assumes that your MongoDB server is running on 'mongodb' host and MySQL server is running on 'mysql' host, as you mentioned in your question.
2. The provided solution might be slow if you have a large number of documents in the 'lineitem' collection because of the join operation. A better solution can be achieved if the data distribution and indexing are known.
