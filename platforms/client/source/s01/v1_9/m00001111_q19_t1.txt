response, Here is the Python script to fetch the data according to your given query. This script would need the PyMongo library for MongoDB & mysql-connector-python for MySQL and pandas to handle and merge the data.

Before executing the Python, you would first need to install these dependencies. Here is the bash command to install these:

```bash
pip install pymongo mysql-connector-python pandas
```

Please note that you would have to firstly ensure `pip` is installed. If you're using Python 3, you might have to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MySQL
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Fetch data from part table
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM PART")
part_table = mycursor.fetchall()
part_df = pd.DataFrame(part_table, columns = ['P_PARTKEY', 'P_NAME', 'P_MFGR', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE', 'P_CONTAINER',
                                              'P_RETAILPRICE', 'P_COMMENT'])

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']
lineitem_col = db['lineitem']

# Fetch data from lineitem collection
lineitem_data = lineitem_col.find()
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_data))

# Merging lineitem & part DataFrame
merged_df = pd.merge(lineitem_df, part_df, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on="P_PARTKEY")

# Filtering data according to the given conditions
final_df = merged_df[((merged_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#12') & (merged_df['P_CONTAINER'].isin(['SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 
                                                                'SM PKG'])) & (merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] >= 1) & 
                      (merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] <= 11) & (merged_df['P_SIZE'].between(1, 5)) & 
                      (merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['AIR', 'AIR REG'])) & 
                      (merged_df['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON')) | 
                     ((merged_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (merged_df['P_CONTAINER'].isin(['MED BAG', 
                      'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK'])) & (merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] >= 10) & 
                      (merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] <= 20) & (merged_df['P_SIZE'].between(1, 10)) & 
                      (merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['AIR', 'AIR REG'])) & 
                      (merged_df['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON')) | 
                     ((merged_df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#34') & (merged_df['P_CONTAINER'].isin(['LG CASE', 
                      'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG'])) & (merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] >= 20) & 
                      (merged_df['L_QUANTITY'] <= 30) & (merged_df['P_SIZE'].between(1, 15)) & 
                      (merged_df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['AIR', 'AIR REG'])) & 
                      (merged_df['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON'))]
                     
# Calculate Revenue
final_df['REVENUE'] = final_df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - final_df['L_DISCOUNT'])
output = final_df['REVENUE'].sum()

# Writing data to CSV
output_df = pd.DataFrame([output], columns=['REVENUE'])
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

This script first connects to MySQL and MongoDB to fetch the data from the `PART` and `lineitem` tables respectively. It then uses pandas to merge the two datasets and filter out the rows based on the conditions in your query. Finally, it calculates REVENUE and writes it to a CSV file named `query_output.csv`.

Note that you should replace 'mysql' and 'mongodb' with your actual MySQL and MongoDB server addresses respectively. Also, replace 'my-secret-pw' with your actual MySQL root password. Please make sure MongoDB's port 27017 is accessible.
