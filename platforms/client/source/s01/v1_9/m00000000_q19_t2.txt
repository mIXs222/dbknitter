For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#12'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 1 AND L_QUANTITY <= 1 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n    OR\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 10 AND L_QUANTITY <= 10 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n    OR\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#34'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 20 AND L_QUANTITY <= 20 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2
