For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use with MongoDB to perform the query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Setup MongoDB client
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
database = client["tpch"]
customer = database["customer"]
orders = database["orders"]

# Aggregate pipeline
pipeline = [
    {"$lookup": {
        "from": "orders",
        "let": {"c_custkey": "$C_CUSTKEY"},
        "pipeline": [
            {"$match":
                {"$expr":
                    {"$and":
                        [
                            {"$eq": ["$O_CUSTKEY", "$$c_custkey"]},
                            {"$not": {"$regex": ".*pending.*deposits.*"}}
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        "as": "order_list"
    }},
    {"$unwind": "$order_list"},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": "$C_CUSTKEY",
        "C_COUNT": {"$sum": 1}
    }},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": "$C_COUNT",
        "CUSTDIST": {"$sum": 1}
    }},
    {"$sort": {
        "CUSTDIST":-1, 
        "C_COUNT":-1
    }},
]

# Execute the aggregation
result = customer.aggregate(pipeline)

# Convert to a data frame
df = pd.DataFrame(list(result))

# Write to a CSV
df.to_csv("query_output.csv", index=False)
```
In Python, MongoDB's left outer join operation is similar to `$lookup`. `$match` can be used to simulate the `NOT LIKE` operation in SQL and `$$` is used to reference variables defined with the `let` block.

For python dependencies you'll need pymongo for MongoDB operations and pandas for handling data, you can install it with pip using following bash command:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```
