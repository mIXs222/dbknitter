response, Certainly, Python is an excellent language for working with databases. I'll provide a Python script that uses the `pymongo` library to run the equivalent query in MongoDB, and `pandas` to format and export the data to CSV. 

First, you need to install those dependencies - Python, `pymongo`, and `pandas`. 

For python3 you can use the following bash command:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pandas pymongo
```

Now, the Python code:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from pandas.io.json import json_normalize

client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client['tpch']

partsupp = list(db.partsupp.find())
part = list(db.part.find())
supplier = list(db.supplier.find())
filtered_supplier_keys = [s['S_SUPPKEY'] for s in supplier if 'Customer Complaints' not in s['S_COMMENT']]

incl_sizes = {49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9}

result_list = []
for p in part:
    if p['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45' and not p['P_TYPE'].startswith('MEDIUM POLISHED') and p['P_SIZE'] in incl_sizes:
        for ps in partsupp:
            if ps['PS_PARTKEY'] == p['P_PARTKEY'] and ps['PS_SUPPKEY'] not in filtered_supplier_keys:
                result_list.append({
                    "P_BRAND": p['P_BRAND'],
                    "P_TYPE": p['P_TYPE'],
                    "P_SIZE": p['P_SIZE'],
                    "SUPPLIER_CNT": len(set(ps['PS_SUPPKEY'])),
                })

df = pd.DataFrame(result_list)
aggregated = df.groupby(['P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'])['SUPPLIER_CNT'].nunique()
aggregated = aggregated.reset_index().sort_values(by=['SUPPLIER_CNT', 'P_BRAND', 'P_TYPE', 'P_SIZE'], ascending=[False, True, True, True])
aggregated.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Please note that MongoDB is a NoSQL database, and as such it does not support the same type of querying as SQL. the main loop in the Python script attempts to imitate the SQL join operation, and filter data according to the WHERE and LIKE conditions.

Also, please be aware that this script could be slow if you have large amounts of data, as Python is not as performant as a dedicated database for such tasks.

In general, if you need to perform complex queries like the one you provided, it might be worth considering using a SQL database, or a NoSQL database that better supports such query operations.
