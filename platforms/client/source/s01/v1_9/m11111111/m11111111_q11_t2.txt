Table region has the following fields: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152).

For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    PS_PARTKEY,\n    SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) AS VALUE\nFROM\n    partsupp,\n    supplier,\n    nation\nWHERE\n    PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'\nGROUP BY\n    PS_PARTKEY HAVING\n    SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) >\n    (\n    SELECT\n        SUM(PS_SUPPLYCOST * PS_AVAILQTY) * 0.0001000000\n    FROM\n        partsupp,\n        supplier,\n        nation\n    WHERE\n        PS_SUPPKEY = S_SUPPKEY\n        AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n        AND N_NAME = 'GERMANY'\n    )\nORDER BY\n    VALUE DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

Please note that MongoDB is a NoSQL database, so we don't have JOINs or SQL queries as such, but we can use lookup for performing operations similar to JOIN.
To install all the dependencies to run the above Python code, execute the following bash command (assuming you're on an Ubuntu system with Python & pip installed)

```bash
sudo pip install pymongo pandas
