Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117).

For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'\n    AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'\n    AND L_QUANTITY < (\n        SELECT\n            0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY)\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY\n    )\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, In order to execute the query, we will first have to establish a connection with the MongoDB databases using a MongoDB client for python called 'pymongo'. 

Before executing python script, ensure to install the necessary python libraries using the following bash commands:

```bash
pip install pymongo
pip install pandas
```

Here is the python code using pymongo:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Establish a connection to the MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client['tpch']

# create empty DataFrame
output_df = pd.DataFrame()

# Get lineitem and part collection
lineItems = db.lineitem
parts = db.part

pipeline = [
    {"$lookup": {
        "from": "part",
        "localField": "L_PARTKEY",
        "foreignField": "P_PARTKEY",
        "as": "part"
    }},
    {"$unwind": "$part"},
    {"$match": {
        "part.P_BRAND": "Brand#23",
        "part.P_CONTAINER": "MED BAG"
    }},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": "$part.P_PARTKEY",
        "avg_qty": {"$avg": "$L_QUANTITY"},
        "total_price": {"$sum": "$L_EXTENDEDPRICE"}
    }}
]

# Aggregate data (perform join operation and compute total extended price and average quantity.)
aggregated_data = lineItems.aggregate(pipeline)

# Iterate over data
for data in aggregated_data:
    if data['avg_qty']*0.2 > data['total_price']:
        single_row = pd.DataFrame({'AVG_YEARLY': data['total_price']}, index=[0])
        output_df = pd.concat([output_df, single_row])

# Ensure the output is divided by 7.0 to get AVG_YEARLY
output_df['AVG_YEARLY'] = output_df['AVG_YEARLY'] / 7.0

# Write to csv
output_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Caveats: 

MongoDB aggregation framework is not as flexible as SQL queries and doing subqueries directly is not supported, so there might be differences in the result when we use MongoDB for queries that are easily written using SQL. Therefore, the provided solution might not perfectly replicate the MySQL result, especially the subquery part, due to limitations of MongoDB.
