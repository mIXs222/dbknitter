Table partsupp has the following fields: PS_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, PS_AVAILQTY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPLYCOST of type DECIMAL(15,2)  and PS_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(199). Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table orders has the following fields: O_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, O_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, O_ORDERSTATUS of type CHAR(1), O_TOTALPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), O_ORDERDATE of type DATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY of type CHAR(15), O_CLERK of type CHAR(15), O_SHIPPRIORITY of type INTEGER and O_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(79). Table lineitem has the following fields: L_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, L_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, L_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, L_LINENUMBER of type INTEGER, L_QUANTITY of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_EXTENDEDPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_DISCOUNT of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_TAX of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_RETURNFLAG of type CHAR(1), L_LINESTATUS of type CHAR(1), L_SHIPDATE of type DATE, L_COMMITDATE of type DATE, L_RECEIPTDATE of type DATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT of type CHAR(25), L_SHIPMODE of type CHAR(10) and L_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(44). \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table nation the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'\n    AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01\n    AND L_QUANTITY < 24\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the python code to execute this query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from decimal import Decimal
import csv

client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client.tpch
lineitem = db.lineitem

pipeline = [
    {'$match':
         {'$and': [
             {'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': '1994-01-01', '$lt': '1995-01-01'}},
             {'L_DISCOUNT': {'$gte': Decimal('.06') - Decimal('0.01'), '$lte': Decimal('.06') + Decimal('0.01')}},
             {'L_QUANTITY': {'$lt': 24}}
         ]}
     },
    {'$group':
         {'_id': None, 
          'REVENUE': {'$sum': {'$multiply': ["$L_EXTENDEDPRICE", "$L_DISCOUNT"]}}}
    },
    {'$project':
         {'_id': 0, 'REVENUE': 1}
    }
]

output = list(lineitem.aggregate(pipeline))

with open(r'query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['REVENUE'])
    for row in output:
        writer.writerow([row['REVENUE']])
```

Let's break it down: 

- The MongoClient(“mongodb://mongodb:27017/”) call creates a MongoClient to the running MongoDB instance.
- lineitem refers to the lineitem table in MongoDB.
- In the $match operation, we filter documents based on the conditions provided in the query.
- In the $group operation, the revenue is calculated by summing up the multiplication of L_EXTENDEDPRICE and L_DISCOUNT after filtering documents.
- We then project the results excluding the default _id field in the $project operation.
- Lastly, we are writing our output to 'query_output.csv'.

Before running this code, you need to install the dependencies. You may do so using pip within a Linux bash shell:

```bash
pip install pymongo csv
```
If you don't have pip installed:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python-pip
```

Please verify that your databases follow these filter conditions as MongoDB does not support direct translation of SQL queries.

Note: Please replace the connection string and database details accordingly. Also, keep in mind that MongoDB date handling is different than traditional SQL databases. Assuming date is stored as string in MongoDB. If it's stored as a datetime object, you need to adjust code accordingly.
