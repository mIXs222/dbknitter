response, Below is the Python code using the "pymongo" library that would be required to execute your query. However, note that MongoDB doesn't support complex joins and other SQL operations directly. You'd have to fetch the data first and then parse and filter it in Python.

But before diving in the code, install the necessary Python libraries with the following bash command:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

And here is the python code to execute your query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from pandas.io.json import json_normalize

client = MongoClient('mongodb://mongodb:27017/')
db = client['tpch']

col_nation = db['nation']
col_region = db['region']
col_part = db['part']
col_supplier = db['supplier']
col_lineitem = db['lineitem']
col_orders = db['orders']
col_customer = db['customer']

nation_data = list(col_nation.find({}))
region_data = list(col_region.find({}))
part_data = list(col_part.find({}))
supplier_data = list(col_supplier.find({}))
lineitem_data = list(col_lineitem.find({}))
orders_data = list(col_orders.find({}))
customer_data = list(col_customer.find({}))

df_nation = pd.json_normalize(nation_data)
df_region = pd.json_normalize(region_data)
df_part = pd.json_normalize(part_data)
df_supplier = pd.json_normalize(supplier_data)
df_lineitem = pd.json_normalize(lineitem_data)
df_orders = pd.json_normalize(orders_data)
df_customer = pd.json_normalize(customer_data)

# Merge tables together similar to SQL joins
df_merge = df_lineitem.merge(df_part, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')
df_merge = df_merge.merge(df_supplier, left_on='L_SUPPKEY', right_on='S_SUPPKEY')
df_merge = df_merge.merge(df_orders, left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='O_ORDERKEY')
df_merge = df_merge.merge(df_customer, left_on='O_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
df_merge = df_merge.merge(df_nation, left_on='C_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY', suffixes=('', '_nation_customer'))
df_merge = df_merge.merge(df_nation, left_on='S_NATIONKEY', right_on='N_NATIONKEY', suffixes=('', '_nation_supplier'))
df_merge = df_merge.merge(df_region, left_on='N_REGIONKEY', right_on='R_REGIONKEY')

# Filter for specific conditions
df_merge = df_merge[
    (df_merge['P_TYPE'] == 'SMALL PLATED COPPER') & 
    (df_merge['R_NAME'] == 'ASIA') & 
    (df_merge['O_ORDERDATE'].between('1995-01-01', '1996-12-31'))]

df_merge['O_YEAR'] = df_merge['O_ORDERDATE'].dt.year
df_merge['VOLUME'] = df_merge['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - df_merge['L_DISCOUNT'])
df_merge['NATION'] = df_merge['N_NAME_nation_supplier']

# Group by and calculate the final result
df_result = df_merge.groupby('O_YEAR').apply(lambda group: group[group['NATION'] == 'INDIA']['VOLUME'].sum() / group['VOLUME'].sum()).reset_index(name='MKT_SHARE')
df_result.sort_values('O_YEAR', inplace=True)
df_result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Disclaimer: This code assumes that 'mongodb' is the host where your MongoDB database is running and it can be accessed at the default '27017' port from where this script runs. Please replace these values with actual host and port if they are different. Also note that MongoDB does not have built-in support for all SQL functionality particularly when it comes to complex Aggregations, Subqueries, Joins, etc. As such, this reflected script may not provide the exact equivalent functionality of the MySQL query. Some post-processing in Python might be required.
