Table region has the following fields: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152).

Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table orders has the following fields: O_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, O_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, O_ORDERSTATUS of type CHAR(1), O_TOTALPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), O_ORDERDATE of type DATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY of type CHAR(15), O_CLERK of type CHAR(15), O_SHIPPRIORITY of type INTEGER and O_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(79). Table lineitem has the following fields: L_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, L_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, L_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, L_LINENUMBER of type INTEGER, L_QUANTITY of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_EXTENDEDPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_DISCOUNT of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_TAX of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_RETURNFLAG of type CHAR(1), L_LINESTATUS of type CHAR(1), L_SHIPDATE of type DATE, L_COMMITDATE of type DATE, L_RECEIPTDATE of type DATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT of type CHAR(25), L_SHIPMODE of type CHAR(10) and L_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(44). \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table nation the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7.0 AS AVG_YEARLY\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'\n    AND P_CONTAINER = 'MED BAG'\n    AND L_QUANTITY < (\n        SELECT\n            0.2 * AVG(L_QUANTITY)\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY\n    )\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the Python code for executing your query using the `pymongo` library.

Dependencies: pandas, pymongo (and their dependencies)

Python code:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")

db = client["tpch"]

def find_avg_quantity():
    pipeline = [
        {
            '$group': {
                '_id': '$P_PARTKEY',
                'avgQuantity': { '$avg': '$L_QUANTITY' }
            }
        }
    ]

    avg_quantity = db.lineitem.aggregate(pipeline)
    return list(avg_quantity)

avg_quantity_list = find_avg_quantity()
avg_quantity_dict = {item['_id']: item['avgQuantity'] for item in avg_quantity_list}

def find_output():
    pipeline = [
        {
            '$lookup': {
                'from': 'part',
                'localField': 'L_PARTKEY',
                'foreignField': 'P_PARTKEY',
                'as': 'part'
            }
        },
        {
            '$match': {
                'part.P_BRAND': 'Brand#23',
                'part.P_CONTAINER': 'MED BAG',
                'L_QUANTITY': { '$lt': avg_quantity_dict['part.P_PARTKEY'] * 0.2 }
            }
        },
        {
            '$group': {
                '_id': None,
                'totalExtendedPrice': { '$sum': '$L_EXTENDEDPRICE' }
            }
        }
    ]

    result = db.lineitem.aggregate(pipeline)
    return list(result)

output_list = find_output()

avg_yearly = output_list[0]['totalExtendedPrice'] / 7.0

df = pd.DataFrame({'AVG_YEARLY': [avg_yearly]})
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

To install the dependencies, you can use the following bash command:

```bash
pip install pandas pymongo
```
 
Note that this MongoDB query might not be the optimal solution since MongoDB is not designed to support complex queries involving multi-stage operations, subqueries, and relation joins like traditional SQL databases. And MongoDB's performance might not be as good as MySQL for executing these types of queries.
 
Please be aware of this and consider moving your data to a SQL-based database if you need to execute complex SQL queries frequently.
