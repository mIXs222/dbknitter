For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    O_YEAR,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN NATION = 'INDIA' THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) / SUM(VOLUME) AS MKT_SHARE\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        strftime('%Y', O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,\n        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME,\n        N2.N_NAME AS NATION\n    FROM\n        part,\n        supplier,\n        lineitem,\n        orders,\n        customer,\n        nation n1,\n        nation n2,\n        region\n    WHERE\n        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n        AND S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY\n        AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n        AND O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY\n        AND C_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND N1.N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY\n        AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'\n        AND S_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'\n        AND P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'\n    ) AS ALL_NATIONS\nGROUP BY\n    O_YEAR\n    ORDER BY\n    O_YEAR\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Below is the Python code that uses pymongo to interact with your MongoDB database and run the equivalent of the SQL query in MongoDB.

First, install the necessary Python package with the following bash command:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Then, Python code for the query:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from bson.son import SON

# Connecting to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client.tpch

# Aggregation pipeline to run the SQL equivalent MongoDB query
pipeline = [
    {"$lookup": {"from": "nation1", "localField": "C_NATIONKEY", "foreignField": "N_NATIONKEY", "as": "nation1"}},
    {"$unwind": "$nation1"},
    {"$lookup": {"from": "orders", "localField": "O_CUSTKEY", "foreignField": "O_ORDERKEY", "as": "orders"}},
    {"$unwind": "$orders"},
    {"$lookup": {"from": "lineitem", "localField": "O_ORDERKEY", "foreignField": "L_ORDERKEY", "as": "lineitem"}},
    {"$unwind": "$lineitem"},
    {"$lookup": {"from": "supplier", "localField": "L_SUPPKEY", "foreignField": "S_SUPPKEY", "as": "supplier"}},
    {"$unwind": "$supplier"},
    {"$lookup": {"from": "part", "localField": "L_PARTKEY", "foreignField": "P_PARTKEY", "as": "part"}},
    {"$unwind": "$part"},
    {"$lookup": {"from": "nation2", "localField": "S_NATIONKEY", "foreignField": "N_NATIONKEY", "as": "nation2"}},
    {"$unwind": "$nation2"},
    {"$lookup": {"from": "region", "localField": "N_REGIONKEY", "foreignField": "R_REGIONKEY", "as": "region"}},
    {"$unwind": "$region"},
    {"$match": {
        "O_ORDERDATE": {"$gte": "1995-01-01", "$lte": "1996-12-31"},
        "region.R_NAME": "ASIA",
        "part.P_TYPE": "SMALL PLATED COPPER"}},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": {"year": {"$year": "$O_ORDERDATE"}},
        "volume": {"$sum": {"$multiply": ["$L_EXTENDEDPRICE", {"$subtract": [1, "$L_DISCOUNT"]}]}}}},
    {"$project": {
        "O_YEAR": "$_id.year",
        "MKT_SHARE": {
            "$cond": [{"$eq": ["$NATION", "INDIA"]}, {"$divide": ["$volume", "$volume"]}, 0]}}},
    {"$sort": SON([("O_YEAR", -1)])}
]

# Execute the pipeline on the 'customer' collection
results = db.customer.aggregate(pipeline)

# Convert result to dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(list(results))

# Write the dataframe to csv file
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Keep in mind, the performance of this query on MongoDB would be quite poor. MongoDB is not optimized for such complex join operations across different collections, unlike SQL databases.
