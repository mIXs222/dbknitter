response, Your user's SQL query can be converted to PyMongo, a Python driver for MongoDB, but the converted query will be very verbose and difficult to maintain because MongoDB does not directly support operations like JOIN, SUBSTR, or IN, which are commonplace in SQL. 

Additionally, the performance will be very bad as we might need multiple passes to the data instead of using the highly optimized SQL engine of MySQL. However, below is a Python script which uses the PyMongo package to implement the SQL query.

Here is the Python code to install the packages:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

And here is the Python code to run the query using PyMongo and write the result to query_output.csv:

```python
import pymongo
import pandas as pd

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]
customer_col = db["customer"]
orders_col = db["orders"]

cntry_codes = ['20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21']

# get the average C_ACCTBAL
cust_data = list(
    customer_col.find({"C_PHONE": {"$in": cntry_codes}, "C_ACCTBAL": {"$gt": 0.00}}))
avg_acctbal = sum(cust['C_ACCTBAL'] for cust in cust_data) / len(cust_data)

# get all customers without orders
no_orders_custkeys = {order['O_CUSTKEY']: None for order in orders_col.find()}
cust_data = [cust for cust in cust_data
             if cust['C_CUSTKEY'] not in no_orders_custkeys and cust['C_ACCTBAL'] > avg_acctbal]

result_data = []
for cntry_code in cntry_codes:
    customers = [cust for cust in cust_data if cust['C_PHONE'].startswith(cntry_code)]
    if customers:
        result_data.append({
            'CNTRYCODE': cntry_code,
            'NUMCUST': len(customers),
            'TOTACCTBAL': sum(cust['C_ACCTBAL'] for cust in customers)
        })

# sort by 'CNTRYCODE'
result_data.sort(key=lambda x: x['CNTRYCODE'])

# write output to csv file
df = pd.DataFrame(result_data)
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Before running the Python script, please make sure you install the required libraries by running the Bash command in the terminal. Once the libraries are installed, you can run the Python script. The result of your query will be saved as "query_output.csv" in your working directory.
