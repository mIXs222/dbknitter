Table region has the following fields: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table part has the following fields: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

Table partsupp has the following fields: PS_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, PS_AVAILQTY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPLYCOST of type DECIMAL(15,2)  and PS_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(199). Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table orders has the following fields: O_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, O_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, O_ORDERSTATUS of type CHAR(1), O_TOTALPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), O_ORDERDATE of type DATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY of type CHAR(15), O_CLERK of type CHAR(15), O_SHIPPRIORITY of type INTEGER and O_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(79). Table lineitem has the following fields: L_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, L_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, L_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, L_LINENUMBER of type INTEGER, L_QUANTITY of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_EXTENDEDPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_DISCOUNT of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_TAX of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_RETURNFLAG of type CHAR(1), L_LINESTATUS of type CHAR(1), L_SHIPDATE of type DATE, L_COMMITDATE of type DATE, L_RECEIPTDATE of type DATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT of type CHAR(25), L_SHIPMODE of type CHAR(10) and L_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(44). \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table nation the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'\n    AND L_DISCOUNT BETWEEN .06 - 0.01 AND .06 + 0.01\n    AND L_QUANTITY < 24\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, First, you will need to make sure you have pymongo and pandas installed the packages will be used for database interaction and data manipulation respectively. 

Here is the bash command to install these packages:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Next is the Python code to execute the query:

```python
# Your Python script must be able to interact with MongoDB 
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime 

# Connect to your MongoDB cluster
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")

# Select your database
db = client["tpch"]

# Select the collection (table)
lineitem = db["lineitem"]

# Build the criteria for the query
start_date = datetime.strptime('1994-01-01', "%Y-%m-%d")
end_date = datetime.strptime('1995-01-01', "%Y-%m-%d")
criteria = {
    'L_SHIPDATE': {'$gte': start_date, '$lt': end_date},
    'L_DISCOUNT': {'$gte': .06 - 0.01, '$lte': .06 + 0.01},
    'L_QUANTITY': {'$lt': 24}
}

# Execute the query
results = lineitem.find(criteria)

# Create pandas dataframe from the result
df = pd.DataFrame(list(results))

# Calculate REVENUE
df['REVENUE'] = df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * df['L_DISCOUNT']
total_revenue = df['REVENUE'].sum()

# Write the output to a CSV file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'REVENUE\n{total_revenue}\n')
```

This script first connects to the MongoDB database or cluster, then selects the `lineitem` collection. It then forms a criteria for filtering the documents in this collection. The result of the find operation, with the criteria applied, is transformed into a pandas DataFrame. Finally, the value for `REVENUE` is calculated by multiplying `L_EXTENDEDPRICE` with `L_DISCOUNT` and then summing it up. The output is written to a CSV file by the name `query_output.csv`.
