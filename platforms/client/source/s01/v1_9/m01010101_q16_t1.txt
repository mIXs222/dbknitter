For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT\nFROM\n    partsupp,\n    part\nWHERE\n    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'\n    AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'\n    AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)\n    AND PS_SUPPKEY NOT IN (\n        SELECT\n            S_SUPPKEY\n        FROM\n            supplier\n        WHERE\n            S_COMMENT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'\n    )\nGROUP BY\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE\nORDER BY\n    SUPPLIER_CNT DESC,\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the Python code that you can use in combination with pymongo and mysql-connector-python to execute your query. It first retrieves data from Mongo and MySQL, combines it, and then performs operations similar to your query on this combined data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def create_mysql_connection(host_name, user_name, user_password, db_name):
    connection = None
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host=host_name,
            user=user_name,
            passwd=user_password,
            database=db_name
        )
        print("MySQL connection is successful")
    except Error as err:
        print(f"Error: '{err}'")

    return connection

def read_mongo_data(host_name, port, db_name, collection_name):
    client = MongoClient(host=host_name, port=port)
    db = client[db_name]
    collection = db[collection_name]
    data = pd.DataFrame(list(collection.find()))
    return data

def query_data(partsupp, part, supplier):
    partsupp_part = pd.merge(partsupp, part, left_on="PS_PARTKEY", right_on="P_PARTKEY")
    partsupp_part = partsupp_part[partsupp_part['P_BRAND'] != 'Brand#45']
    partsupp_part = partsupp_part[~partsupp_part['P_TYPE'].str.startswith("MEDIUM POLISHED")]
    partsupp_part = partsupp_part[partsupp_part['P_SIZE'].isin([49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9])]
    supplier = supplier[supplier['S_COMMENT'].str.contains("Customer Complaints")]
    result = partsupp_part[~partsupp_part['PS_SUPPKEY'].isin(supplier['S_SUPPKEY'])]
    result = result.groupby(['P_BRAND','P_TYPE','P_SIZE'])['PS_SUPPKEY'].nunique().reset_index(name="SUPPLIER_CNT")
    result = result.sort_values(['SUPPLIER_CNT','P_BRAND','P_TYPE','P_SIZE'], ascending=[False,True,True,True])
    result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Create MySQL connection
connection = create_mysql_connection("mysql", "root", "my-secret-pw", "tpch")

# Read data from MySQL
part = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM PART", connection)
partsupp = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM PARTSUPP", connection)

# Read data from MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
db = client['tpch']
supplier = read_mongo_data("mongodb", 27017, "tpch", "supplier")

# Execute query
query_data(partsupp, part, supplier)
```

Before running the above code, make sure all necessary packages are installed. Here is the bash command for installation:
```bash
pip install pandas pymongo mysql-connector-python
