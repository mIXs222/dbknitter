response, To install the python dependencies in order to execute this SQL query using Python, you can use the following bash command:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas

To execute your SQL query in python, the resultant python script would be:

```python

    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host=host,

Run this script as follows:

```bash
python script.py
```

Please ensure that you replace 'script.py' with the actual name of the python script file.

This python script connects to the database using the provided credentials, executes the SQL query, converts the result into a Pandas DataFrame and finally writes the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'query_output.csv'. It uses the 'mysql.connector' library for connecting to the MySQL database and 'pandas' for dealing with the data.
