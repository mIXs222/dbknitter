For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    S_NAME,\n    S_ADDRESS\nFROM\n    supplier,\n    nation\nWHERE\n    S_SUPPKEY IN (\n    SELECT\n        PS_SUPPKEY\n    FROM\n        partsupp\n    WHERE\n    PS_PARTKEY IN (\n        SELECT\n            P_PARTKEY\n        FROM\n            part\n        WHERE\n            P_NAME LIKE 'forest%'\n    )\n    AND PS_AVAILQTY > (\n        SELECT\n            0.5 * SUM(L_QUANTITY)\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n        AND L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY\n        AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n        AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'\n        )\n    )\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_NAME = 'CANADA'\nORDER BY\n    S_NAME\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, The following Python code opens a connection to the specified MySQL database, runs the mentioned SQL query on the data stored in the respective tables on a MySQL server, and writes the query output to a CSV file.

```python
import mysql.connector

    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
      host="mysql",
      user="root",
      password="my-secret-pw",

    )

    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
