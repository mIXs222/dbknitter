Table REGION has the following columns: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_NAME,\n    C_CUSTKEY,\n    O_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_TOTALPRICE,\n    SUM(L_QUANTITY)\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY IN (\n    SELECT\n        L_ORDERKEY\n    FROM\n        lineitem\n    GROUP BY\n    L_ORDERKEY HAVING\n        SUM(L_QUANTITY) > 300\n    )\nAND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\nAND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\nGROUP BY\n    C_NAME,\n    C_CUSTKEY,\n    O_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_TOTALPRICE\nORDER BY\n    O_TOTALPRICE DESC,\n    O_ORDERDATE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Before running the code, you need to install python mysql connector and pandas library which can be done by the following bash command:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas
```

Here is the Python code :

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# Create a function to connect to the MySQL database
def create_db_connection(host_name, user_name, user_password, db_name):
    connection = None
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host=host_name,
            user=user_name,
            passwd=user_password,
            database=db_name
        )
        print("MySQL Database connection successful")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Error: '{err}'")

    return connection

# Function to execute query
def execute_query(connection, query):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query)
        print("Query successful")
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        return result
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Error: '{err}'")

# Database Connection Details
host = "mysql"
user = "root"
password = "my-secret-pw"
database = "tpch"

# SQL Query
query = '''SELECT C_NAME, C_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_TOTALPRICE, SUM(L_QUANTITY)
           FROM customer, orders, lineitem
           WHERE O_ORDERKEY IN (SELECT L_ORDERKEY FROM lineitem GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY HAVING SUM(L_QUANTITY) > 300)
           AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
           AND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
           GROUP BY C_NAME, C_CUSTKEY, O_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERDATE, O_TOTALPRICE
           ORDER BY O_TOTALPRICE DESC,O_ORDERDATE'''

# Create a connection to the database
connection = create_db_connection(host, user, password, database)

# Execute the query and fetch the result
res = execute_query(connection, query)

# Convert the result into pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(res, columns=['C_NAME', 'C_CUSTKEY', 'O_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_TOTALPRICE', 'SUM(L_QUANTITY)'])

# Write output to a CSV file
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

```

You can run this python script by placing it in a file, say `script.py`, then executing that file with the command `python script.py`. Feel free to adjust the database host name, user name, password, and database name to match your system setup.
