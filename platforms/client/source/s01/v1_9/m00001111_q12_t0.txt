Table REGION has the following columns: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117).

For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    L_SHIPMODE,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY = '1-URGENT'\n            OR O_ORDERPRIORITY = '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS HIGH_LINE_COUNT,\n    SUM(CASE\n            WHEN O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '1-URGENT'\n            AND O_ORDERPRIORITY <> '2-HIGH'\n            THEN 1\n            ELSE 0\n    END) AS LOW_LINE_COUNT\nFROM\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')\n    AND L_COMMITDATE < L_RECEIPTDATE\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < L_COMMITDATE\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n    AND L_RECEIPTDATE < '1995-01-01'\nGROUP BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\nORDER BY\n    L_SHIPMODE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is your python code to execute the query on your original data. This script is with using the pymysql and pymongo packages for MySQL and MongoDB respectively, and pandas package for handling the data.

Python script (main.py):

```python
import pymysql
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# MySQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
cursor = mysql_conn.cursor(pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

# MongoDB Connection
mongo_client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
mongo_db = mongo_client["tpch"]

# SQL Query
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM orders;"
cursor.execute(sql_query)
orders = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall())

# MongoDB Query
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(mongo_db.lineitem.find()))

# Merge the two dataframes on O_ORDERKEY and L_ORDERKEY
merged = pd.merge(orders, lineitem, left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

# Apply the conditions and grouping specified in the query
output = merged[
    (merged['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['MAIL', 'SHIP'])) & 
    (merged['L_COMMITDATE'] < merged['L_RECEIPTDATE']) &
    (merged['L_SHIPDATE'] < merged['L_COMMITDATE']) &
    (merged['L_RECEIPTDATE'] >= '1994-01-01') &
    (merged['L_RECEIPTDATE'] < '1995-01-01')
].groupby('L_SHIPMODE').apply(lambda group: pd.Series({
    'HIGH_LINE_COUNT': sum((group['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == '1-URGENT') | (group['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] == '2-HIGH')),
    'LOW_LINE_COUNT': sum((group['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] != '1-URGENT') & (group['O_ORDERPRIORITY'] != '2-HIGH'))
})).reset_index()

# Writing the output to the csv file
output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

To install the required dependencies, you would use the following bash command.

Bash command:

```bash
pip install pymysql pymongo pandas
