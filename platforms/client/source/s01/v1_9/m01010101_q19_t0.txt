response, Python code to execute this query:

Combined MySQL, MongoDB, and file-writing operations in Python can get a bit complex. The following code uses pandas dataframe to merge SQL and NoSQL data. 

First you need to install some python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas mysql-connector-python pymongo
```

Python Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient
import csv

# MySQL connection
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)

# Create cursors
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Execute the query and fetch the result into 'lineitem' and 'part' pandas dataframes
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM PART")
part = pd.DataFrame(mycursor.fetchall(), columns = [i[0] for i in mycursor.description])

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['tpch']
lineitem_collection = db['lineitem']

# Fetch all documents from 'lineitem' collection
lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(lineitem_collection.find({}, {'_id': False})))

# Merge both pandas dataframes
df = pd.merge(part, lineitem, left_on='P_PARTKEY', right_on='L_PARTKEY')

# Filter merged dataframe as per conditions given in SQL query
df = df[(
          (df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#12') & (df['P_CONTAINER'].isin(['SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG'])) 
          & (df['L_QUANTITY'].between(1, 11)) & (df['P_SIZE'].between(1, 5))
          & (df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['AIR', 'AIR REG'])) & (df['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON') 
          ) 
         | 
         (
          (df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#23') & (df['P_CONTAINER'].isin(['MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK']))
          & (df['L_QUANTITY'].between(10, 20)) & (df['P_SIZE'].between(1, 10))
          & (df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['AIR', 'AIR REG'])) & (df['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON')  
         )
         |
         (
          (df['P_BRAND'] == 'Brand#34') & (df['P_CONTAINER'].isin(['LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG']))
          & (df['L_QUANTITY'].between(20, 30)) & (df['P_SIZE'].between(1, 15))
          & (df['L_SHIPMODE'].isin(['AIR', 'AIR REG'])) & (df['L_SHIPINSTRUCT'] == 'DELIVER IN PERSON')   
         )]

# Calculate revenue
df['REVENUE'] = df['L_EXTENDEDPRICE']* (1 - df['L_DISCOUNT'])

# Write output to csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index = False)
```

Remember to replace the 'localhost' in MongoDB connection string with your actual hostname if you are not running it on your local machine.

Please note that it is not possible to directly query MongoDB in the same way it is done for SQL-based systems, since MongoDB is not a relational database. This means that in order to apply the same logic and conditions of the SQL query to the MongoDB collection, you will have to pull the relevant data from MongoDB into pandas, perform the operations there, and then write the results back to MongoDB or to a file.
