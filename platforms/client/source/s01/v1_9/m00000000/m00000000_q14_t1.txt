Table REGION has the following columns: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23). Table SUPPLIER has the following columns: S_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, S_NAME of type CHAR(25), S_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), S_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, S_PHONE of type CHAR(15), S_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2) and S_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(101). Table PARTSUPP has the following columns: PS_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, PS_AVAILQTY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPLYCOST of type DECIMAL(15,2)  and PS_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(199). Table CUSTOMER has the following columns: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table ORDERS has the following columns: O_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, O_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, O_ORDERSTATUS of type CHAR(1), O_TOTALPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), O_ORDERDATE of type DATE, O_ORDERPRIORITY of type CHAR(15), O_CLERK of type CHAR(15), O_SHIPPRIORITY of type INTEGER and O_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(79). Table LINEITEM has the following columns: L_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, L_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, L_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, L_LINENUMBER of type INTEGER, L_QUANTITY of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_EXTENDEDPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_DISCOUNT of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_TAX of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_RETURNFLAG of type CHAR(1), L_LINESTATUS of type CHAR(1), L_SHIPDATE of type DATE, L_COMMITDATE of type DATE, L_RECEIPTDATE of type DATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT of type CHAR(25), L_SHIPMODE of type CHAR(10) and L_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(44). \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table NATION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)\n    ELSE 0\n    END) / SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS PROMO_REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY\n    AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01'\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Python Code:

```python
import mysql.connector
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Establish a connection to the database
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw', host='mysql', database='tpch')

# Prepare a cursor
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Prepare the SQL query
query = ("SELECT 100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) ELSE 0 END) / SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS PROMO_REVENUE FROM lineitem, part WHERE L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01' AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01'")

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all the rows
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Prepare the CSV file
with open('query_output.csv','w',newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["PROMO_REVENUE"]) # Write the header
    for row in rows:
        writer.writerow(row) # Write each result row

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

Bash Command To Install All Dependencies:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python csv
```

The Python code first establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided credentials (user, password, host, database).
Then, the given SQL query is executed, and the result is fetched and written to a CSV file named 'query_output.csv'.
The writerow method of the csv.writer object is used to write each row of the result set to the CSV file.
