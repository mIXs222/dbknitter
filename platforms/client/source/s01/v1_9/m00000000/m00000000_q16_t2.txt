response, To execute this query using Python, you will need to install the `pymysql` and `pandas` packages. 

Install them using the following command.

```bash
pip install pymysql pandas
```

Here's the Python script to execute your SQL query and write the output to a csv file.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql

# Open database connection
db = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', 
                     user='root', 
                     passwd='my-secret-pw', 
                     db='tpch')

# SQL Query
sql = """
SELECT
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE,
    COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT
FROM
    partsupp,
    part
WHERE
    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY
    AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'
    AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'
    AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
    AND PS_SUPPKEY NOT IN (
        SELECT
            S_SUPPKEY
        FROM
            supplier
        WHERE
            S_COMMENT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
    )
GROUP BY
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE
ORDER BY
    SUPPLIER_CNT DESC,
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE
"""

# Execute SQL and fetch the result into pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql(sql, con=db)

# Write result to csv
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Disconnect from server
db.close()
```

You can run this script by saving it into a file (let's say `query.py`) and run it with Python:

```bash
python query.py
```

Just make sure your Python environment has the `pymysql` and `pandas` packages installed. Also, replace the database hostname, username, and password with your actual values.
