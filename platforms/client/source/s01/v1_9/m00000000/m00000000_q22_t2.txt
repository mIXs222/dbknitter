For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table CUSTOMER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    CNTRYCODE,\n    COUNT(*) AS NUMCUST,\n    SUM(C_ACCTBAL) AS TOTACCTBAL\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        SUBSTR(C_PHONE, 1 , 2) AS CNTRYCODE,\n        C_ACCTBAL\n    FROM\n        customer\n    WHERE\n        SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN\n        ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')\n    AND C_ACCTBAL > (\n            SELECT\n                AVG(C_ACCTBAL)\n            FROM\n                customer\n            WHERE\n                C_ACCTBAL > 0.00\n            AND SUBSTR(C_PHONE , 1 , 2) IN\n            ('20', '40', '22', '30', '39', '42', '21')\n    )\n    AND NOT EXISTS (\n        SELECT\n            *\n        FROM\n            orders\n        WHERE\n            O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY\n        )\n    ) AS CUSTSALE\nGROUP BY\n    CNTRYCODE\nORDER BY\n    CNTRYCODE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2
