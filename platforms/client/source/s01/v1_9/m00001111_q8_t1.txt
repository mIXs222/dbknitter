For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    O_YEAR,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN NATION = 'INDIA' THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) / SUM(VOLUME) AS MKT_SHARE\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        strftime('%Y', O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,\n        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME,\n        N2.N_NAME AS NATION\n    FROM\n        part,\n        supplier,\n        lineitem,\n        orders,\n        customer,\n        nation n1,\n        nation n2,\n        region\n    WHERE\n        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n        AND S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY\n        AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n        AND O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY\n        AND C_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND N1.N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY\n        AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'\n        AND S_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'\n        AND P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'\n    ) AS ALL_NATIONS\nGROUP BY\n    O_YEAR\n    ORDER BY\n    O_YEAR\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, Firstly you need to generate a Python code to connect to both MySQL and MongoDB databases, mash up the necessary tables and then execute the provided SQL Query on top of that. As this is a potentially complex operation, the Python code might look like this:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Establishing connection with MySQL
engine = create_engine(f"mysql+pymysql://{os.getenv('MYSQL_USER')}:{os.getenv('MYSQL_PASSWORD')}@{os.getenv('MYSQL_HOST')}/{os.getenv('MYSQL_DATABASE')}")

# Read MySQL tables into dataframes
part_df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM part", engine)
supplier_df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM supplier", engine)
nation_df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM nation", engine)
region_df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM region", engine)

# Establishing MongoDB client
client = MongoClient(f"mongodb://{os.getenv('MONGO_HOST')}:{os.getenv('MONGO_PORT')}")

# Assigning the database
db = client[os.getenv('MONGODB_DATABASE')]

# Loading MongoDB collections into dataframes
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db['lineitem'].find()))
orders_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db['orders'].find()))
customer_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db['customer'].find()))
partsupp_df = pd.DataFrame(list(db['partsupp'].find()))

#Concatenating all dataframes into single dataframe
all_dfs = [part_df, supplier_df, nation_df, region_df, lineitem_df, orders_df, customer_df, partsupp_df]

final_df = pd.concat(all_dfs, axis=0, ignore_index=True)

# Writing the query
query = '''
SELECT
    O_YEAR,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NATION = 'INDIA' THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) / SUM(VOLUME) AS MKT_SHARE
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        strftime('%Y', O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME,
        N2.N_NAME AS NATION
    FROM
        final_df
    WHERE
        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY
        AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
        AND O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY
        AND C_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY
        AND N1.N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY
        AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'
        AND S_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY
        AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'
        AND P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'
    ) AS ALL_NATIONS
GROUP BY
    O_YEAR
    ORDER BY
    O_YEAR
'''

# Executing the query and saving the outcome to a dataframe
out_df = pd.read_sql_query(query, final_df)

# Writing the dataframe to a .csv file
out_df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

As you see, the Python code uses pandas library to handle the data, PyMySQL to connect with MySQL database, PyMongo to connect with MongoDB database and SQLAlchemy to execute SQL queries. 

To install these dependencies, following bash command can be used:
```bash
pip install pandas pymysql pymongo sqlalchemy python-dotenv
```
