response, To execute the SQL query using Python, use the `pymysql` library. It allows you to connect to your MySQL database and execute queries directly from Python.

First, we need to install pymysql library in python using bash command:

```bash
pip install pymysql pandas
```

Then, here is your Python Code:

```python
import pymysql
import pandas as pd

# Creating connection
connection = pymysql.connect(host='mysql',
                             user='root',
                             password='my-secret-pw',
                             db='tpch')

# Query
query = """
SELECT O_YEAR, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN NATION = 'INDIA' THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) / SUM(VOLUME) AS MKT_SHARE 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR, 
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME, 
        N2.N_NAME AS NATION 
    FROM part, supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, nation N1, nation N2, region 
    WHERE P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY 
        AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY 
        AND O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY 
        AND C_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY 
        AND N1.N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY 
        AND R_NAME = 'ASIA' 
        AND S_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY 
        AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31' 
        AND P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'
) AS ALL_NATIONS 
GROUP BY O_YEAR 
ORDER BY O_YEAR;
"""

# Using pandas to execute the SQL query and store it in a dataframe
df = pd.read_sql(query, connection)

# Export the data to CSV
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

# Closing the connection
connection.close()
```
In your SQL, you have used `strftime` function. MySQL doesn't have this function. Instead, you can use date time functions like `YEAR, MONTH, DAY, etc.`.  
And also in MySQL, double quotes are not used for strings. We use single quotes. Hence, I had modified your SQL a bit in Python code.
