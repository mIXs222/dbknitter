Table supplier has the following fields: S_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, S_NAME of type CHAR(25), S_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), S_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, S_PHONE of type CHAR(15), S_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2) and S_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(101).

For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, In order to execute the query on your original data, you will need to extract data from both MySQL and MongoDB databases, and join them in your Python script. I would recommend using pandas to handle your data and create dataframes (similar to tables in SQL). You can then use pandas functions to apply the same logic that's in the SQL query.

Here's the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from pymongo import MongoClient
import urllib.parse

# MySQL connection
engine = create_engine('mysql://root:my-secret-pw@mysql:3306/tpch')

# Query MySQL to get customers and orders
with engine.connect() as con:
    df_customers = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER', con)
    df_orders = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM ORDERS', con)

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['tpch']

# Query MongoDB to get customers and orders
df_m_customers = pd.DataFrame(list(db.customer.find()))
df_m_orders = pd.DataFrame(list(db.orders.find()))

# Merge Mongodb data onto original MySQL data
df_customers = df_customers.append(df_m_customers)
df_orders = df_orders.append(df_m_orders)

# Merge customer and orders
df = pd.merge(df_customers, df_orders, how='left', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY')

# Filter condition
df = df[~df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending', na=False) 
        & ~df['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('deposits', na=False)]

C_ORDERS = df.groupby('C_CUSTKEY')['O_ORDERKEY'].count().reset_index(name='C_COUNT')

result = C_ORDERS.groupby('C_COUNT')['C_CUSTKEY'].count().reset_index(name='CUSTDIST')

result = result.sort_values(by=['CUSTDIST', 'C_COUNT'], ascending=[False, False])

# Export to csv
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Here's the bash command to install pandas, sqlalchemy, pymongo and the MySQL connector for python:

```bash
pip install pandas sqlalchemy pymongo mysql-connector-python
