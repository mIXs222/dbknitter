For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    S_NAME,\n    S_ADDRESS\nFROM\n    supplier,\n    nation\nWHERE\n    S_SUPPKEY IN (\n    SELECT\n        PS_SUPPKEY\n    FROM\n        partsupp\n    WHERE\n    PS_PARTKEY IN (\n        SELECT\n            P_PARTKEY\n        FROM\n            part\n        WHERE\n            P_NAME LIKE 'forest%'\n    )\n    AND PS_AVAILQTY > (\n        SELECT\n            0.5 * SUM(L_QUANTITY)\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n        AND L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY\n        AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n        AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'\n        )\n    )\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_NAME = 'CANADA'\nORDER BY\n    S_NAME\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here's the Python code to perform the SQL query operation in MongoDB using pymongo and Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

def mongo_connect(host, port, db):
    conn = MongoClient(host, port)
    return conn[db]

def execute_query():
    db = mongo_connect("mongodb", 27017, "tpch")

    suppliers = pd.DataFrame(list(db.supplier.find({}, {"_id": 0, "S_NAME": 1, "S_ADDRESS": 1, "S_SUPPKEY": 1, "S_NATIONKEY": 1})))
    nations = pd.DataFrame(list(db.nation.find({}, {"_id": 0, "N_NATIONKEY": 1, "N_NAME": 1})))
    parts = pd.DataFrame(list(db.part.find({"P_NAME": {"$regex": "^forest"}}, {"_id": 0, "P_PARTKEY": 1})))
    partsupps = pd.DataFrame(list(db.partsupp.find({}, {"_id": 0, "PS_PARTKEY": 1, "PS_SUPPKEY": 1, "PS_AVAILQTY": 1})))
    lineitems = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find({"L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte": "1994-01-01", "$lt": "1995-01-01"} } , {"_id": 0, "L_PARTKEY": 1, "L_SUPPKEY": 1, "L_QUANTITY": 1})))

    merge1 = pd.merge(partsupps, parts, how="inner", left_on="PS_PARTKEY", right_on="P_PARTKEY")
    merge2 = pd.merge(merge1, lineitems, how="inner", left_on=["PS_PARTKEY", "PS_SUPPKEY"], right_on=["L_PARTKEY", "L_SUPPKEY"])
    merge3 = pd.merge(merge2, suppliers, how="inner", left_on="PS_SUPPKEY", right_on="S_SUPPKEY")
    final_df = pd.merge(merge3, nations, how="inner", left_on="S_NATIONKEY", right_on="N_NATIONKEY")

    final_df = final_df[final_df["N_NAME"] == "CANADA"]
    final_df = final_df[final_df["PS_AVAILQTY"] > 0.5 * final_df["L_QUANTITY"].sum()]
    final_df[["S_NAME", "S_ADDRESS"]].to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)

execute_query()

This Python script is required to be run after installing the Python environment and dependencies. The dependencies for Python can be installed by running the following bash command:
```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```
It's important to note that this script doesn't exactly mimic the SQL query since MongoDB does not support SQL-like operations. Therefore, the operations are performed in-memory using Pandas dataframes which may have performance implications for large datasets.
The MongoDB query filters are only applied to fields that do not require calculated values (e.g. SUM, AVG) in WHERE clauses of the subqueries. For fields that require calculated values, the corresponding Pandas code was used instead.

Finally, the bash command given installs the pymongo library for interaction with MongoDB and pandas library for handling tabular data and calculation in Python.
Please ensure enough memory is available for running this script. This should not be utilized for large data amounts.
