For table LINEITEM the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    O_YEAR,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN NATION = 'INDIA' THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) / SUM(VOLUME) AS MKT_SHARE\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        strftime('%Y', O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,\n        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME,\n        N2.N_NAME AS NATION\n    FROM\n        part,\n        supplier,\n        lineitem,\n        orders,\n        customer,\n        nation n1,\n        nation n2,\n        region\n    WHERE\n        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n        AND S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY\n        AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n        AND O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY\n        AND C_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND N1.N_REGIONKEY = R_REGIONKEY\n        AND R_NAME = 'ASIA'\n        AND S_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'\n        AND P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'\n    ) AS ALL_NATIONS\nGROUP BY\n    O_YEAR\n    ORDER BY\n    O_YEAR\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2
