For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table part the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, The python code to run the query would use the PyMongo module to interact with your MongoDB database. However, MongoDB doesn't support SQL-like joins or like operators as MySQL does. As such, we have to retrieve data separately then perform transformations with Pandas which supports SQL-like operations. Here is your requested Python code:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# connect to the MongoDB server, database and respective collections
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]
customer_coll = db["customer"]
orders_coll = db["orders"]

# get data from collections
cust_data = pd.DataFrame(list(customer_coll.find()))
orders_data = pd.DataFrame(list(orders_coll.find()))

# Perform left join
merged = pd.merge(cust_data, orders_data, left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='O_CUSTKEY', how='left')

# Exclude rows with O_COMMENT containing 'pending' and 'deposits'
merged = merged[~merged['O_COMMENT'].str.contains('pending|deposits', na=False)]

c_orders = merged.groupby('C_CUSTKEY')['O_ORDERKEY'].count().reset_index(name='C_COUNT')

custdist = c_orders.groupby('C_COUNT').size().reset_index(name='CUSTDIST')

# Sort by CUSTDIST descending and C_COUNT descending
result = custdist.sort_values(by=['CUSTDIST', 'C_COUNT'], ascending=[False, False])

# Write to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

To run above Python code, you need Python installed on your machine along with couple of Python modules such as pymongo and pandas. 

You can use the following bash command to install all the necessary Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

Please keep in mind that this will require a MongoDB server running on your localhost at port 27017. Also, make sure the pip involves the same Python version which you use to run your program.

The bash command assumes that you already have Python and pip installed on your system. If not, you would need to install them first:

For Python:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

For pip:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
