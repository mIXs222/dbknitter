For table REGION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table SUPPLIER the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table partsupp the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table orders the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#12'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 1 AND L_QUANTITY <= 1 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n    OR\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 10 AND L_QUANTITY <= 10 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n    OR\n    (\n    P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#34'\n    AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')\n    AND L_QUANTITY >= 20 AND L_QUANTITY <= 20 + 10\n    AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15\n    AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')\n    AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'\n    )\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, To execute the provided SQL query on data that is split across MySQL and MongoDB databases, we need to get the data from the MongoDB, put it in a Python DataFrame and then execute the query using the pandasql module. 

But first, let's install the necessary dependencies: 

Bash command: 

```bash
pip install pandas numpy mysql-connector-python pymongo pandasql
```

And here's the Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandasql import sqldf
from pymongo import MongoClient
from mysql.connector import connect
import csv

# connecting to the mysql server
cnx = connect(user='root', password='my-secret-pw',
              host='mysql', database='tpch')

# creating a cursor object
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# fetching data from the PART table
query = ("SELECT * FROM PART")
cursor.execute(query)

# putting fetched data into a pandas dataframe
part_df = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall(), columns=[i[0] for i in cursor.description])

# connecting to the mongodb server
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)

# accessing the tpch database
db = client.tpch

# fetching data from the lineitem collection
cursor = db.lineitem.find()

# putting fetched data into a pandas dataframe
lineitem_df = pd.DataFrame(list(cursor))

# defining a function to execute sql on pandas dataframes
pysqldf = lambda q: sqldf(q, globals())

# executing the query and storing the result in a dataframe
result = pysqldf("""
    SELECT
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE* (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
    FROM
        lineitem_df as lineitem,
        part_df as part
    WHERE
        (
        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#12'
        AND P_CONTAINER IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
        AND L_QUANTITY >= 1 AND L_QUANTITY <= 1 + 10
        AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 5
        AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
        AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
        )
        OR
        (
        P_PARTKEY = L_PARTKEY
        AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#23'
        AND P_CONTAINER IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
        AND L_QUANTITY >= 10 AND L_QUANTITY <= 10 + 10
        AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 10

        (

        AND P_BRAND = 'Brand#34'
        AND P_CONTAINER IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
        AND L_QUANTITY >= 20 AND L_QUANTITY <= 20 + 10
        AND P_SIZE BETWEEN 1 AND 15
        AND L_SHIPMODE IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
        AND L_SHIPINSTRUCT = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
        )
""")

# Closing the MySQL connection
cnx.close()
# Closing the MongoDB connection
client.close()

# Writing the output to CSV file
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
```

This script:


- Connects to the MySQL and MongoDB databases.
- Fetches data from the PART and lineitem collections.
- Executes the provided SQL query on this data.
- Writes the result of the query to a CSV file named query_output.csv.
