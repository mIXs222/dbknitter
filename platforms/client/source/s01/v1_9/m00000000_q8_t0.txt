response, To convert this SQL query to Python code, you'd want to use the Python SQL toolkit SQLAlchemy to manage connections to your SQL database and execute your queries. We'll also use pandas to save the output to a CSV file.

Firstly, you would need to install necessary dependencies. Here is the bash command:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pandas mysql-connector-python
```

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# create a connection to the database
engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://root:my-secret-pw@mysql/tpch')

# the SQL query
query = """
SELECT
    O_YEAR,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NATION = 'INDIA' THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) / SUM(VOLUME) AS MKT_SHARE
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        YEAR(O_ORDERDATE) AS O_YEAR,
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME,

    FROM

        AND P_TYPE = 'SMALL PLATED COPPER'
    ) AS ALL_NATIONS
GROUP BY
    O_YEAR
ORDER BY
    O_YEAR
"""

# execute the query and fetch the data
data = pd.read_sql_query(query, engine)

# write the data to a CSV file
data.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

I've modified the query a little because MySQL does not support the `strftime` function. Instead, I've used MySQL's `YEAR` function to get the year from a date.
