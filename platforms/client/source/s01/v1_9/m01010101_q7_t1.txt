For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    SUPP_NATION,\n    CUST_NATION,\n    L_YEAR,\n    SUM(VOLUME) AS REVENUE\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        N1.N_NAME AS SUPP_NATION,\n        N2.N_NAME AS CUST_NATION,\n        strftime('%Y', L_SHIPDATE) AS L_YEAR,\n        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS VOLUME\n    FROM\n        supplier,\n        lineitem,\n        orders,\n        customer,\n        nation n1,\n        nation n2\n    WHERE\n        S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY\n        AND O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY\n        AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND S_NATIONKEY = N1.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND C_NATIONKEY = N2.N_NATIONKEY\n        AND (\n            (N1.N_NAME = 'JAPAN' AND N2.N_NAME = 'INDIA')\n            OR (N1.N_NAME = 'INDIA' AND N2.N_NAME = 'JAPAN')\n            )\n        AND L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'\n    ) AS SHIPPING\nGROUP BY\n    SUPP_NATION,\n    CUST_NATION,\n    L_YEAR\nORDER BY\n    SUPP_NATION,\n    CUST_NATION,\n    L_YEAR\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, You need to make sure the Python dependencies are installed first:

Bash command to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy mysql-connector-python pymongo
```

Here is a Python code to execute your query:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pymysql
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# MYSQL Connection
mysql_conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# MongoDB Connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]

# Pandas options
pd.set_option('display.expand_frame_repr', False)

# Get data in pandas dataframe
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM NATION"
df_mysql_nation = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, mysql_conn)

sql_query = "SELECT * FROM PART"
df_mysql_part = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, mysql_conn)

sql_query = "SELECT * FROM PARTSUPP"
df_mysql_partsupp = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, mysql_conn)

sql_query = "SELECT * FROM ORDERS"
df_mysql_orders = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, mysql_conn)

df_mongo_region = pd.DataFrame(list(db.region.find()))

df_mongo_supplier = pd.DataFrame(list(db.supplier.find()))

df_mongo_customer = pd.DataFrame(list(db.customer.find()))

df_mongo_lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find()))

# Join dataframes and processes data
df_join = pd.merge(df_mysql_nation, df_mongo_supplier, how='inner', left_on='N_NATIONKEY', right_on='S_NATIONKEY')
df_join = pd.merge(df_join, df_mysql_orders, how='inner', left_on='O_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')
df_join = pd.merge(df_join, df_mongo_customer, how='inner', left_on='C_CUSTKEY', right_on='C_CUSTKEY')
df_join = pd.merge(df_join, df_mongo_lineitem, how='inner', left_on='L_ORDERKEY', right_on='L_ORDERKEY')

df_join = df_join[(df_join['N1.N_NAME'] == 'JAPAN') & (df_join['N2.N_NAME'] == 'INDIA') | (df_join['N1.N_NAME'] == 'INDIA') & (df_join['N2.N_NAME'] == 'JAPAN')]
df_join = df_join[(df_join['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1995-01-01') & (df_join['L_SHIPDATE'] <= '1996-12-31')]
df_join['VOLUME'] = df_join['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - df_join['L_DISCOUNT'])
df_join['YEAR'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df_join['L_SHIPDATE']).year

output = df_join.groupby(['SUPP_NATION', 'CUST_NATION', 'YEAR'])['VOLUME'].sum().reset_index()

# Write to .csv
output.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```
Please note that since some part of the data are from MongoDB and some are from MySQL, we have to retrieve all data first and then perform the operations. Also, in this case, for simplicity, we are joining all tables together based on conditions in the original query, which might result in a huge DataFrame and use a lot of memory. It would probably be a good idea to optimize the data querying process based on your data size and actual requirements.
