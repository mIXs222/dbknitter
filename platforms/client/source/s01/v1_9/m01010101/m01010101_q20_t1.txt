Table region has the following fields: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table supplier has the following fields: S_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, S_NAME of type CHAR(25), S_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), S_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, S_PHONE of type CHAR(15), S_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2) and S_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(101).

For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    S_NAME,\n    S_ADDRESS\nFROM\n    supplier,\n    nation\nWHERE\n    S_SUPPKEY IN (\n    SELECT\n        PS_SUPPKEY\n    FROM\n        partsupp\n    WHERE\n    PS_PARTKEY IN (\n        SELECT\n            P_PARTKEY\n        FROM\n            part\n        WHERE\n            P_NAME LIKE 'forest%'\n    )\n    AND PS_AVAILQTY > (\n        SELECT\n            0.5 * SUM(L_QUANTITY)\n        FROM\n            lineitem\n        WHERE\n            L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n        AND L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY\n        AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'\n        AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'\n        )\n    )\n    AND S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY\n    AND N_NAME = 'CANADA'\nORDER BY\n    S_NAME\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the python code to create a MongoDB and MySQL connection to run the above queries. You will require the pymongo and mysql-connector-python packages for MongoDB and MySQL database connectivity:

Python code:

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector
import pymongo

# create connection to mysql
mysql_conn = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_conn.cursor()

# run the sub-queries in MYSQL
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT P_PARTKEY FROM part WHERE P_NAME LIKE 'forest%'")
partkeys = [item[0] for item in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]

mysql_cursor.execute("""SELECT SUM(L_QUANTITY)
                         FROM lineitem
                         WHERE L_PARTKEY IN (%s)
                            AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1994-01-01'
                            AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-01-01'""" % ','.join(partkeys))
sum_quantity = mysql_cursor.fetchone()[0]

mysql_cursor.execute("""SELECT PS_SUPPKEY
                         FROM partsupp
                         WHERE PS_PARTKEY IN (%s)
                         AND PS_AVAILQTY > %s""" % (','.join(partkeys), str(sum_quantity/2)))
suppkeys = [item[0] for item in mysql_cursor.fetchall()]

# Create connection to MongoDB
mongo_conn = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mongodb = mongo_conn["tpch"]

# Query the MongoDB 'supplier' collection based on the supp keys found from MYSQL
suppliers = mongodb.supplier.find({"S_SUPPKEY": {"$in": suppkeys}})

# Query the MongoDB 'nation' collection
nations = list(mongodb.nation.find({"N_NATIONKEY": "CANADA"}))
nationkeys = [n["N_NATIONKEY"] for n in nations]

# write to csv
with open("query_output.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["S_NAME", "S_ADDRESS"])
    for s in suppliers:
        if s['S_NATIONKEY'] in nationkeys:
            writer.writerow([s["S_NAME"], s["S_ADDRESS"]])

print('Query output written to query_output.csv')
```

Bash command for installing required dependencies:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo
