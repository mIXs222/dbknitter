Table supplier has the following fields: S_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, S_NAME of type CHAR(25), S_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), S_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, S_PHONE of type CHAR(15), S_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2) and S_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(101). Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117).

For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nwith revenue0 as\n(select\n  L_SUPPKEY as SUPPLIER_NO,\n  sum(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as TOTAL_REVENUE\n  from\n  lineitem\n  where\n  L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01'\n  AND L_SHIPDATE < date('1996-01-01', '+3 month')\n  group by\n  L_SUPPKEY)\nselect\nS_SUPPKEY,\nS_NAME,\nS_ADDRESS,\nS_PHONE,\nTOTAL_REVENUE\nfrom\nsupplier,\nrevenue0\nwhere\nS_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER_NO\nand TOTAL_REVENUE = (\n  select\n  max(TOTAL_REVENUE)\n  from\n  revenue0\n)\norder by\nS_SUPPKEY\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Surely. The following python code will execute the query considering the use of MySQL and MongoDB:

Python Code:
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# MySQL connection
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="mysql",
  user="root",
  password="my-secret-pw",
  database="tpch"
)
cursor = mydb.cursor(dictionary=True)

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongodb = client['tpch']

pipeline = [
    {
        "$match": { 
            "L_SHIPDATE": { "$gte": '1996-01-01', "$lt": '1996-04-01' }
        }
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": "$L_SUPPKEY", 
            "TOTAL_REVENUE": { 
                "$sum": { 
                    "$multiply": ["$L_EXTENDEDPRICE", { "$subtract": [1, "$L_DISCOUNT"] }] 
                }
            }
        }
    }
]

# getting revenue from MongoDB
line_item_revenue = list(mongodb["lineitem"].aggregate(pipeline))

# getting suppliers details from MySQL
query = "SELECT S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME, S_ADDRESS, S_PHONE FROM supplier"
cursor.execute(query)
suppliers = cursor.fetchall()

# perform join operation similar to SQL
df1 = pd.DataFrame(suppliers)
df2 = pd.DataFrame(line_item_revenue)
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, how='inner', left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='_id')

max_revenue = df["TOTAL_REVENUE"].max()

df = df[df['TOTAL_REVENUE'] == max_revenue]

df.sort_values('S_SUPPKEY').to_csv("query_output.csv", index=False)
```

You can install dependencies with the following bash commands:

```bash
pip install pandas pymongo mysql-connector-python
```

Please note that you must have Python and the pip package installer installed on your system before executing these commands. Make sure to replace MongoDB and MySql connection parameters with your actual server parameters. 

Also, this code assumes that date fields in MongoDB are stored in 'YYYY-MM-DD' string format. If dates are stored in a different format, you may need to adjust the date filtering in Python. 

And always be careful while using databases credentials and don't push them into code repositories.
