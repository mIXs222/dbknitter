Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23). Table PARTSUPP has the following columns: PS_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, PS_AVAILQTY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPLYCOST of type DECIMAL(15,2)  and PS_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(199).

Table region has the following fields: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table supplier has the following fields: S_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, S_NAME of type CHAR(25), S_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), S_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, S_PHONE of type CHAR(15), S_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2) and S_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(101). Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table lineitem has the following fields: L_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, L_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, L_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, L_LINENUMBER of type INTEGER, L_QUANTITY of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_EXTENDEDPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_DISCOUNT of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_TAX of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_RETURNFLAG of type CHAR(1), L_LINESTATUS of type CHAR(1), L_SHIPDATE of type DATE, L_COMMITDATE of type DATE, L_RECEIPTDATE of type DATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT of type CHAR(25), L_SHIPMODE of type CHAR(10) and L_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(44). \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table NATION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nFROM\n    customer,\n    orders,\n    lineitem\nWHERE\n    C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'\n    AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n    AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY\n    AND O_ORDERDATE < '1995-03-15'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE > '1995-03-15'\nGROUP BY\n    L_ORDERKEY,\n    O_ORDERDATE,\n    O_SHIPPRIORITY\nORDER BY\n    REVENUE DESC,\n    O_ORDERDATE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is a Python code to execute this query on your data:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pymysql

# MySQL connection
engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://root:my-secret-pw@mysql/tpch')
connection = engine.connect()

# querying MySQL
orders_query = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM ORDERS", connection)
nation_query = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM NATION", connection)

# MongoDb connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]

# fetching data from MongoDb
customer_data = pd.DataFrame(list(db.customer.find({})))
lineitem_data = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find({})))

# merging MySQL and MongoDb data
merged_data = pd.merge(orders_query, customer_data, left_on = 'O_CUSTKEY', right_on = 'C_CUSTKEY')
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, lineitem_data, left_on = 'O_ORDERKEY', right_on = 'L_ORDERKEY')

# applying the conditions from the SQL query
filtered_data = merged_data.loc[(merged_data['C_MKTSEGMENT'] == 'BUILDING') & 
                                (merged_data['O_ORDERDATE'] < '1995-03-15') & 
                                (merged_data['L_SHIPDATE'] > '1995-03-15')]

# calculating revenue
filtered_data['REVENUE'] = filtered_data['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - filtered_data['L_DISCOUNT'])

# selecting the columns needed for the final output
final_data = filtered_data[['L_ORDERKEY', 'REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY']]

# sorting and grouping data
final_data = final_data.sort_values(by = ['REVENUE', 'O_ORDERDATE'], ascending = [False, True])
final_data = final_data.groupby(['L_ORDERKEY', 'O_ORDERDATE', 'O_SHIPPRIORITY'], as_index = False).sum()

# writing the output to a csv
final_data.to_csv('query_output.csv', index = False)

```

And here is the bash command to install all the necessary libraries and dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas pymongo sqlalchemy pymysql
```
Please note that this Python code is to be run in an environment where Python3 is installed. Also, the `pymysql` library is a MySQL connector which allows interaction with MySQL from Python. Similarly, `pymongo` is a MongoDB connector to interact with MongoDB from Python. The `sqlalchemy` library is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system which provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns. Also, please understand that you may need to edit your host and port names as per your settings.
