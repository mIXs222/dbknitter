For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT\nFROM\n    partsupp,\n    part\nWHERE\n    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY\n    AND P_BRAND <> 'Brand#45'\n    AND P_TYPE NOT LIKE 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'\n    AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)\n    AND PS_SUPPKEY NOT IN (\n        SELECT\n            S_SUPPKEY\n        FROM\n            supplier\n        WHERE\n            S_COMMENT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'\n    )\nGROUP BY\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE\nORDER BY\n    SUPPLIER_CNT DESC,\n    P_BRAND,\n    P_TYPE,\n    P_SIZE\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data.

response, Firstly, the installation of all required dependencies needs to be done using pip.

Bash command:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas pymongo dnspython
```

Next, the Python code to execute the query:

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

# connect to mysql
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)
mysql_cursor = mysql_db.cursor()

# connect to mongodb
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mongodb = client['tpch']

# execute subquery on mongodb
subquery_result = mongodb.supplier.find({"S_COMMENT": {'$regex':'Customer.*Complaints'}}, {"S_SUPPKEY": 1})

# get all 'S_SUPPKEY' values from the subquery results
excluded_suppkeys = [item['S_SUPPKEY'] for item in subquery_result]

# MYSQL Query
mysql_query = """
SELECT
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE,
    COUNT(DISTINCT PS_SUPPKEY) AS SUPPLIER_CNT

WHERE
    P_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY

    AND P_SIZE IN (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)
    AND PS_SUPPKEY NOT IN ({})
GROUP BY
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE
ORDER BY
    SUPPLIER_CNT DESC,
    P_BRAND,
    P_TYPE,
    P_SIZE
""".format(','.join(map(str,excluded_suppkeys))) # converting list of suppkeys to csv and inserting in query

# executing the MYSQL query
mysql_cursor.execute(mysql_query)

# fetch results and write it to csv file
result = mysql_cursor.fetchall()

# Create a pandas dataframe from SQL query result 
df = pd.DataFrame(result, columns=["P_BRAND", "P_TYPE", "P_SIZE", "SUPPLIER_CNT"])
df.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False) # write the dataframe to CSV file
```

Please note, this code will create a CSV file where this python code is running. Please ensure all the dependencies are installed using the given bash command before executing this python code on your system. Additionally, this code assumes that MongoDB and MySQL servers are running on the same host. If not, you have to edit the code accordingly.
