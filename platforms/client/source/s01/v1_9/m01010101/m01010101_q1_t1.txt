response, To execute the above query using Python, you first need to establish a connection to your databases. Here's Python code using both the mysql-connector-python and pymongo libraries to connect to MySQL and MongoDB, respectively:

Python code:

```python
import csv
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connecting MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['tpch']
collection_lineitem = db['lineitem']

# Get all lineitems from MongoDB
lineitems = list(collection_lineitem.find())

# Connecting MySQL
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='mysql',
    user='root',
    password='my-secret-pw',
    database='tpch'
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Query result will be stored here
query_output = []

# Iterate over lineitems
for lineitem in lineitems:
    mycursor.execute(
        """SELECT
                L_RETURNFLAG,
                L_LINESTATUS,
                SUM({L_QUANTITY}) AS SUM_QTY,
                SUM({L_EXTENDEDPRICE}) AS SUM_BASE_PRICE,
                SUM({L_EXTENDEDPRICE} * (1 - {L_DISCOUNT})) AS SUM_DISC_PRICE,
                SUM({L_EXTENDEDPRICE} * (1 - {L_DISCOUNT}) * (1 + {L_TAX})) AS SUM_CHARGE,
                AVG({L_QUANTITY}) AS AVG_QTY,
                AVG({L_EXTENDEDPRICE}) AS AVG_PRICE,
                AVG({L_DISCOUNT}) AS AVG_DISC,
                COUNT(*) AS COUNT_ORDER
            FROM
                lineitem
            WHERE
                L_SHIPDATE <= '1998-09-02'
            GROUP BY
                L_RETURNFLAG,
                L_LINESTATUS
            ORDER BY
                L_RETURNFLAG,
                L_LINESTATUS""".format(**lineitem)
    )
    query_output += mycursor.fetchall()

# Write the query output to query_output.csv file
with open('query_output.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(query_output)
```

This Python script would generate a file query_output.csv containing the query result.

To install necessary dependencies, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Run this command on your command line:

Bash command:

```
pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo
```

The python code above makes an assumption that the MongoDB documents structure matches exactly the MySQL table structure and that all necessary fields exist in each document. If that's not the case you would need to adjust the query and data extraction accordingly. 

Please note, extracting all documents from a MongoDB collection to the memory of your application could be very inefficient (or even impossible) if the collection contains many documents. You might need to adjust the script (for instance, processing documents in chunks) to suit your needs. 

You cannot run a SQL query that directly pulls from two databases that use different database management systems (i.e., MySQL and MongoDB). You would need to pull the data from the MongoDB collection and the MySQL table separately, then utilize Python to combine them according to the necessary relations and execute the aggregations.
