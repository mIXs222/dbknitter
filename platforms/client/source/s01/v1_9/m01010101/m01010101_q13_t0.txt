Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23).

Table supplier has the following fields: S_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, S_NAME of type CHAR(25), S_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), S_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, S_PHONE of type CHAR(15), S_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2) and S_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(101).

For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    C_COUNT,\n    COUNT(*) AS CUSTDIST\nFROM\n    (\n    SELECT\n        C_CUSTKEY,\n        COUNT(O_ORDERKEY) AS C_COUNT\n    FROM\n        customer LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON\n        C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY\n        AND O_COMMENT NOT LIKE '%pending%deposits%'\n    GROUP BY\n        C_CUSTKEY\n    )   C_ORDERS\nGROUP BY\n    C_COUNT\nORDER BY\n    CUSTDIST DESC,\n    C_COUNT DESC\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, Here is the python code to execute the query on your data.

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import mysql.connector
import csv
from collections import defaultdict

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="mysql",
    user="root",
    password="my-secret-pw",
    database="tpch"
)

# Connect to MongoDB database
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
mongo_db = mongo_client['tpch']

# Get data from MongoDB
customer_data = list(mongo_db['customer'].find({}, {"_id": 0}))
lineitem_data = list(mongo_db['lineitem'].find({}, {"_id": 0}))

# Get data from MySQL
mysql_cursor = mysql_db.cursor()
mysql_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM ORDERS")
mysql_data = mysql_cursor.fetchall()
mysql_db.close()

# Convert MySQL data to dictionary
orders_dict = defaultdict(list)
for row in mysql_data:
    orders_dict[row[1]].append(row[0])

# Process data from MongoDB
result = defaultdict(int)
for row in customer_data:
    count = len([i for i in orders_dict[row['C_CUSTKEY']] if 'pending' not in i and 'deposits' not in i])
    if count:
        result[count] += 1

# Write output to CSV
with open('query_output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["C_COUNT", "CUSTDIST"])
    for key, value in result.items():
        writer.writerow([key, value])
```

For the Python code to run, your system needs to have Python installed along with a few other dependencies. Below is a bash command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pymongo mysql-connector-python
