For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nwith revenue0 as\n(select\n  L_SUPPKEY as SUPPLIER_NO,\n  sum(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as TOTAL_REVENUE\n  from\n  lineitem\n  where\n  L_SHIPDATE >= '1996-01-01'\n  AND L_SHIPDATE < date('1996-01-01', '+3 month')\n  group by\n  L_SUPPKEY)\nselect\nS_SUPPKEY,\nS_NAME,\nS_ADDRESS,\nS_PHONE,\nTOTAL_REVENUE\nfrom\nsupplier,\nrevenue0\nwhere\nS_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER_NO\nand TOTAL_REVENUE = (\n  select\n  max(TOTAL_REVENUE)\n  from\n  revenue0\n)\norder by\nS_SUPPKEY\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, First, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following bash command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyodbc pandas pymongo python-dateutil
```

For Python code, you'll need to use two different database connectors since your data is split between MySQL and MongoDB. 

```python
import pyodbc
import pymongo
import pandas as pd
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to MySQL
conn_str = (
    r'DRIVER={MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver};'
    r'SERVER=mysql;'
    r'DATABASE=tpch;'
    r'USER=root;'
    r'PASSWORD=my-secret-pw;'
)
cnxn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)

# MongoDB Connection
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb:27017/")
db = client["tpch"]

supplier = pd.DataFrame(list(db.supplier.find({})))
supplier = supplier[['S_SUPPKEY', 'S_NAME', 'S_ADDRESS', 'S_PHONE']]

lineitem = pd.DataFrame(list(db.lineitem.find({"L_SHIPDATE": {"$gte" : datetime.now() - relativedelta(months=3)}})))
lineitem['TOTAL_REVENUE'] = lineitem['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - lineitem['L_DISCOUNT'])
revenue0 = lineitem.groupby('L_SUPPKEY').agg({'TOTAL_REVENUE':'sum'}).reset_index()
revenue0.columns = ['SUPPLIER_NO', 'TOTAL_REVENUE']
revenue0['TOTAL_REVENUE'] = revenue0['TOTAL_REVENUE'].astype(float)

merged = pd.merge(supplier, revenue0, how='left', left_on='S_SUPPKEY', right_on='SUPPLIER_NO')
merged['TOTAL_REVENUE'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

max_revenue = merged['TOTAL_REVENUE'].max()
final_df = merged[merged['TOTAL_REVENUE'] == max_revenue]

final_df.to_csv('query_output.csv')

cnxn.close()
client.close()
```

Please note:
1. You need to replace server name, database name, username and password with your actual MySQL server's details in the connection string.
2. You need to install a MySQL ODBC driver in order to use `pyodbc` to connect to your MySQL DB.
3. You should replace mongoDB connection string with your actual MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB connection string.
4. I've assumed that the date column in MongoDB is datetime type and you are calculating revenue for last 3 months.
5. Run the Python script in the same directory where you want your CSV (query_output.csv) to be created. 

Remember to also ensure that your MongoDB and SQL have the required ports open and are configured to accept connections from wherever you're running this script.
