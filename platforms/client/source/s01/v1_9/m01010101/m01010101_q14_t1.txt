Table PART has the following columns: P_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, P_NAME of type VARCHAR(55), P_MFGR of type CHAR(25), P_BRAND of type CHAR(10), P_TYPE of type VARCHAR(25), P_SIZE of type INTEGER, P_CONTAINER of type CHAR(10), P_RETAILPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2) and P_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(23). Table PARTSUPP has the following columns: PS_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, PS_AVAILQTY of type INTEGER, PS_SUPPLYCOST of type DECIMAL(15,2)  and PS_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(199).

Table region has the following fields: R_REGIONKEY of type INTEGER, R_NAME of type CHAR(25) and R_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(152). Table supplier has the following fields: S_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, S_NAME of type CHAR(25), S_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), S_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, S_PHONE of type CHAR(15), S_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2) and S_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(101). Table customer has the following fields: C_CUSTKEY of type INTEGER, C_NAME of type VARCHAR(25), C_ADDRESS of type VARCHAR(40), C_NATIONKEY of type INTEGER, C_PHONE of type CHAR(15), C_ACCTBAL of type DECIMAL(15,2)  , C_MKTSEGMENT of type CHAR(10) and C_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(117). Table lineitem has the following fields: L_ORDERKEY of type INTEGER, L_PARTKEY of type INTEGER, L_SUPPKEY of type INTEGER, L_LINENUMBER of type INTEGER, L_QUANTITY of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_EXTENDEDPRICE of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_DISCOUNT of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_TAX of type DECIMAL(15,2), L_RETURNFLAG of type CHAR(1), L_LINESTATUS of type CHAR(1), L_SHIPDATE of type DATE, L_COMMITDATE of type DATE, L_RECEIPTDATE of type DATE, L_SHIPINSTRUCT of type CHAR(25), L_SHIPMODE of type CHAR(10) and L_COMMENT of type VARCHAR(44). \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table NATION the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PART the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table PARTSUPP the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table ORDERS the database name is tpch, the username is root, the password is my-secret-pw and the hostname is mysql.  For table region the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table supplier the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table customer the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  For table lineitem the database name is tpch, the port is 27017 and the hostname is mongodb.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: \nSELECT\n    100.00 * SUM(CASE WHEN P_TYPE LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)\n    ELSE 0\n    END) / SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS PROMO_REVENUE\nFROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\nWHERE\n    L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY\n    AND L_SHIPDATE >= '1995-09-01'\n    AND L_SHIPDATE < '1995-10-01'\n\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, To implement the query with your current data partition, you need to use two separate python libraries, `pymysql` and `pymongo`, to retrieve data from MySQL and MongoDB databases, respectively. After that you need to use `pandas` for data manipulation and to execute the query. Here is the python code implementation:

Python Code:
```
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Function to connect MySQL
def create_conn():
    conn = pymysql.connect(host='mysql', user='root', password='my-secret-pw', db='tpch')
    return conn

# Load data from MySQL
def load_mysql_data(table, conn):
    query = f'SELECT * FROM {table}'
    df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
    return df

# Load data from MongoDB
def load_mongo_data(collection):
    client = MongoClient('mongodb', 27017)
    db = client['tpch']
    data = db[collection].find()
    df = pd.DataFrame(list(data))
    return df

# connect mysql
conn = create_conn()

# load data from mysql and mongodb
df_part = load_mysql_data('part', conn)
df_lineitem = load_mongo_data('lineitem')

# merge data
df_merged = pd.merge(df_lineitem, df_part, left_on='L_PARTKEY', right_on='P_PARTKEY')

# filter data
df_filtered = df_merged[(df_merged['L_SHIPDATE'] >= '1995-09-01') & 
                        (df_merged['L_SHIPDATE'] < '1995-10-01')]

# calculate promo revenue
df_filtered['PROMO_REVENUE'] = df_filtered.apply(lambda row: 100.00 * row['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * 
                                                  (1 - row['L_DISCOUNT']) if 'PROMO%' in row['P_TYPE'] else 0, axis=1)
df_filtered['TOTAL_REVENUE'] = df_filtered['L_EXTENDEDPRICE'] * (1 - df_filtered['L_DISCOUNT'])
promo_revenue = df_filtered['PROMO_REVENUE'].sum() / df_filtered['TOTAL_REVENUE'].sum()

# write to csv
pd.DataFrame([promo_revenue], columns=['PROMO_REVENUE']).to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

To run this python code, you need to install the dependencies. Use the following bash command to install the required python libraries:

Bash command:
```bash
pip install pymysql pymongo pandas
```

This command will install the needed dependencies for your python code. Remember to run this python script in an environment where you have rights to install packages, and you have Python3 and pip3 installed.
