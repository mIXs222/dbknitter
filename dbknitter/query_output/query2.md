Table table2 has the following columns: NAME of type string, FAMILY_SIZE of type int, ADDRESS of type string and PHONE of type string. \nDetails of my databases are as follows :  For table table1 the database name is basicInfo, the username is root, the password is mySecret and the hostname is localhost.  For table table3 the database name is interestInfo and the hostname is localhost3.  For table table2 the database name is familyInfo, the username is root, the password is mySecret2 and the hostname is localhost2.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: SELECT basicInfo.AGE, interestInfo.INTERESTS \nFROM basicInfo JOIN  interestInfo ON basicInfo.NAME = interestInfo.NAME\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, The task involves reading from a MongoDB database and a MySQL database which requires different libraries. Here is your Python code:

```python
import mysql.connector
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

# Create MySQL connection
mydb1 = mysql.connector.connect(
 host="localhost",
 user="root",
 passwd="mySecret",
 database="basicInfo"
)

mydb2 = mysql.connector.connect(
 host="localhost2",
 user="root",
 passwd="mySecret2",
 database="familyInfo"
)

# Create cursor
mycursor1 = mydb1.cursor()
mycursor2 = mydb2.cursor()

# Execute query
mycursor1.execute("SELECT NAME, AGE FROM table1")
mycursor2.execute("SELECT NAME FROM table2")

# Fetch all rows
mysql_data1 = mycursor1.fetchall()
mysql_data2 = mycursor2.fetchall()

# Convert to dataframe
df_mysql1 = pd.DataFrame(mysql_data1, columns=["NAME", "AGE"])
df_mysql2 = pd.DataFrame(mysql_data2, columns=["NAME"])

# Create MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost3:27017/")
db = client["interestInfo"]

# Fetch all documents
mongodb_data = db.table3.find()

# Convert to dataframe
df_mongodb = pd.DataFrame(list(mongodb_data))

# Merge dataframes
result = pd.merge(df_mysql1, df_mongodb, on='NAME')
result = pd.merge(result, df_mysql2, on='NAME')

# Write to CSV
result.to_csv('query_output.csv', index=False)
```

Your bash command to install all dependencies is as follows:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python pymongo pandas
```
