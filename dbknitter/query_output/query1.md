For table table3 the database name is interestInfo and the hostname is localhost3.  For table table2 the database name is familyInfo, the username is root, the password is mySecret2 and the hostname is localhost2.  \nBut the user of my data thinks all the data is stored in mysql with the same column names.\nWith that assumption, they wrote the following query: SELECT basicInfo.NAME, interestInfo.INTERESTS \nFROM basicInfo JOIN  interestInfo ON basicInfo.NAME = interestInfo.NAME\nGenerate a python code to execute this query on my original data. Query's output should be written to the file query_output.csv. Please output only the python code and a bash command to installtion all dependencies to run that python code."},2

response, First, let's outline the libraries in Python that are needed for this: pymysql for connecting with MySQL database, pymongo for connecting with MongoDB database, and pandas for managing and exporting data. The Python code to run the query is:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient 
import pymysql.cursors

# Connect to the MySQL databases
connection1 = pymysql.connect(host='localhost',
                              user='root',
                              password='mySecret',
                              db='basicInfo')
cursor1 = connection1.cursor()

connection2 = pymysql.connect(host='localhost2',
                              user='root',
                              password='mySecret2',
                              db='familyInfo')
cursor2 = connection2.cursor()

# Connect to the MongoDB
client = MongoClient('localhost3')
db = client['interestInfo']
collection = db['table3']

# Query MySQL database
query1 = "SELECT NAME FROM table1"
df1 = pd.read_sql(query1, connection1)

# Query MongoDB
records = collection.find({})
df3 =  pd.DataFrame(records)

# Merge pandas dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df3, on='NAME')

# Write to csv
merged_df.to_csv('query_output.csv')
```

To run this Python code, these are the libraries you are needed to install.
Installation command will be:

```bash
pip install pandas pymongo PyMySQL
```

Please note if your setup of mongodb requires a password or a different way to connect please adjust the MongoClient line accordingly.
Also, the script assumes that there is only one logical relationship between the tables, which is based on the NAME field. Moreover, this script does not handle any other filtering conditions or JOINs between the MySQL tables as those were not reflected in the provided SQL query. If such conditions or JOINs exist, please adjust the code appropriately, possibly by adding where clauses, modifying the merge operation, or adding other necessary pandas operations.
