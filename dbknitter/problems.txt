1. Chatgpt missed a few necessary installations in the bash script
2. chatgpt had some hidden characters in the python code (or maybe a thing slack adds when sending code through it)
3. We kept hostnames as 'mysql' and 'mongodb' wihc seemed to confuse chatgpt and it used 'localhost' instead in the code generated. Need to make hostnames more distinct
4. mongodb is case sensitive. So all tablenames should be small case
5. Dropping the table row instead of dropping just a field in query
